      "what a smartphone can do. But everything that this pin does, a modern smartphone\n",
      "does better and faster, and easier and in higher quality, and just better in every way. Like your smartphone obviously takes better pictures and videos, and you can frame things more easily. Of course, a phone can call\n",
      "and text people more easily. You can use it in more\n",
      "places, loud places, private places, use it\n",

      "these conversations, but it doesn't see any\n",
      "of these conversations. So if you're texting here, this is not the same thread. That gap is always gonna be there. So I guess that begs the question, why didn't they just make\n",

      "standalone device someday. And in order to get it to that future, they can't set the precedent now of connecting it to your\n",
      "phone, 'cause then that means they have to remove that\n",
      "feature in the future, and they don't wanna do that. So this device as it exists today is hamstrung by its ideal\n",
      "future version of itself. It's like Vision Pro. Like I talked about it\n",
      "in the Vision Pro review. It doesn't actually pair\n",
      "to your iPhone in any way. It's its own standalone computer. And of course, Apple sees down the road, that could just be like a\n",
      "little pair of smart glasses. You don't need an iPhone to use that. But now, today, this thing is a victim of its future ambition. (mellow instrumental music) It was really hard to come up\n",
      "with a title for this video, but I will say, at one point, my working title for this was, \"This product is either\n",

      "unique first person videos. I could put it in the center\n",
      "of my chest, and take videos. I would never want to\n",
      "distract myself while driving taking a video, but you know, even though the quality's not great, that's the most frictionless\n",
      "version of that, along with smart glasses. That's great. And I think number one,\n",
      "on top of all of this, is if you ask me like, \"Who should buy this device right now?\" I mean, nobody should buy\n",
      "this device right now. But if there's one person\n",
      "who would most consider it, it's the person that wants to spend as little time as possible\n",
      "with a screen in their hands. Like as little time as\n",
      "possible on their phone. And that's me sometimes. I don't wanna doom scroll the second I pull my\n",
      "phone out of my pocket. For that person, if they want that at the\n",
      "expense of everything else, this device represents just a glimmer of hope for that future. Now the problem, of course,\n",
      "is with this device, there's just so much more\n",
      "friction and fumbling and annoyance that comes with it, that you don't wanna do it, even though you would accomplish the goal of less screen time and\n",
      "living in the moment. But yeah, that's the issue with it. I literally had a moment, like we did a shoot in Ohio the other day, which was like a travel day. And I woke up in the\n",

      "with this pin today.\" Like I have driving, so the\n",

      "and then put it on again, which means I have to log\n",
      "in with the pin again and... Just all this, and I just was like, \"I don't wanna have to\n",

      "['00:00:00 - 00:02:00: Another year, another gift guide—without the expensive, sponsored crap you\\'ll see everywhere else. Gather round for legitimately cool gadgets you probably haven\\'t heard of—some of my favorites, and some of yours too. Oh, and save for one product, none of these are sponsored. I hate the multi-monitor lifestyle, but I do find myself wanting to place a static window on a smaller display—with the hilariously named Kwumsy K3, I can! This thing is an RGB mechanical keyboard, laptop I/O hub, SSD enclosure, and 13\" touchscreen—all in one. Supply it power, data, and video from your laptop or desktop and you\\'re off to the races. You\\'ve got access to the fairly bandwith-limited but still capable 5Gbps throughput for other USB devices, SD cards, and even an M.2-sized SSD. The keyboard is nice with surprisingly fancy double-shot PBT caps and less fancy generic yellow MX-style switches. That said, the switches are solderless so you can use the included tool to pop them right out and substitute your preferred combo. Neato. The screen is 1920x720 and has a luminance of 300 nits. It’s not fantastic—viewing angles are less than superb—but when angled right, looks better than the specs may suggest and having the ability to use it at any angle makes it the perfect 10-point multitouch sketch pad for Windows, a suitable social feed for macOS, and even a cyberdeck console for Raspberry Pi. All of us carry a flashlight around with us every day, but a smartphone is a pretty lousy one—this is the Aurora A8. It\\'s a teeny-tiny LED flashlight that brightens to an insane 650 lumens. Don\\'t know how bright that is? Well, here\\'s an iPhone 15 Pro,\\n', \"00:02:01 - 00:04:01: and here's this little flashlight. Yeah, not only does the single button toggle through brightness settings, but it also has a UV light onboard to inspect currency and sketchy hotel rooms, it has a red light great for use when dark without losing night vision, it can flash if you have it attached to a backpack to alert cars of your presence, and it has a flood light to illuminate an area like a tent. It runs for hours on its internal battery, charges via USB-C, and comes with a clip, keyring, and magnetic base to attach to basically anything. It's amazing. If you're a 90s kid that grew up on Bop-It like I did, you'll love Flipslide. This cheap puzzle game has you flip and slide colored tiles to match those displayed on-screen. What sounds simple gets really intense with a variety of game modes from a simon-says-style mode to level mode which gives you increasingly less time as you progress and even multiplayer mode that had my wife and I laughing hysterically. It's perfect to play alone or with friends and priced the way it is, it's impossible to say no to. Get it. You should also get the Dyad Pro and S8 Pro Ultra from today's sponsor, Roborock. You may recall Roborock sponsored last year's gift guide—I personally sought them out to sponsor again this year because I love their products so much. The Dyad Pro is a cordless wet-dry vacuum that handles basically anything you can throw at it. Multiple brush rollers underneath the device wet and scrub your floor free of sticky, stainy grime within 1mm of walls and the powerful 17,000 pascal motor sucks up all of the waste—both wet and dry. The onboard DirTech smart sensor analyzes grime concentration on the rollers and adjusts water flow and suction accordingly to handle all tasks. Most wet-dry vacs are more hassle than they're worth, but not the Dyad Pro because\\n\", \"00:04:06 - 00:06:06: upon returning it to its dock it self-cleans and hot-air dries the entire system making it ready day after day, week after week. There's even an onboard cleaning concentrate dispenser for scrubbing with surfactants, so you really only have to add clean water—and empty the dirty tank—when you feel like it. And the only thing better than a gadget that lessens work is one that removes it entirely—that's where the Roborock S8 Pro Ultra comes in. This vacuum is exceptional at its primary job—picking up debris—thanks to its dual-roller brush design and class-leading 6,000 pascal suction. This thing will get hair, crumbs, food, and more—from both hardwood and carpet. When the latter is detected, suction is boosted and the mop is raised so as to not touch rug and carpet fibers. Oh yeah, this thing mops too with its VibraRise system that scrubs the floor pretty aggressively removing a surprising amount of floor grime. When its finished its task, the bot returns to its all-in-one dock that empties the dust bin, washes the mop pad, hot-air dries said pad and station to avoid mildew, refills the on-board water tank, and charges the bot for its next journey. It's a great vacuum and mop, but the reason I've continued to use Roborock vacuums exclusively on the main floor of my home the past 4 years is the excellent, class-leading app and navigation system. Not only is it easy to issue commands and set schedules, but most importantly, my S8 Pro Ultra has vacuumed for nearly 200 hours since I got it earlier this year, and in the past month, it hasn't failed a route even once. It almost never gets stuck avoiding any obstacles placed before it, requires essentially zero maintenance, and keeps my floor clean for weeks before I have to think about lifting a finger. It's seriously one of the best tech gadgets I've ever owned—period. I love it and know you will too—be sure to check out\\n\", '00:06:06 - 00:08:06: the S8 Pro Ultra and Dyad Pro while their Black Friday deals are ongoing using the links below. ISDT is a brand known to anyone that pilots drones or RC cars as they make some of the best LiPo battery chargers on the market. What I didn\\'t know until recently is that they also make an absolute chungus 200W USB charger. This thing has 3 type-C PD ports that can deliver 65/65/and a highly unusual, but amazing 140W—maxing out even the 16\" M3 Max MacBook Pro under full load while fast charging. Furthermore, the lone USB-A port supports up to 24W with support for all protocols like Qualcomm QuickCharge. A handsome LCD display reads out the wattage being pushed to each device including to the wireless charging pad which uses an MFi-certified MagSafe puck that pushes the full 15W of wireless power the iPhone is capable of. Given that making chargers is literally ISDT\\'s bread-and-butter, I was unsurprised but pleased to see quiet active cooling and overheat protection triggers. There’s even an app—if you want such a thing—and it comes with 2 high-quality 240W-capable Type-C cables. For the price they’re asking, it’s a steal. Wired headphones are back in amongst the youth, I hear, and the Questyle M15 is a must-have HiFi accessory for any wired headphones-listener. It\\'s a USB-C powered DAC and headphone amp in an insanely tiny package. In years past, this small size would suggest lousy amplification capabilities, but no... this thing is nuts: it can power my super inefficient Audeze LCD-3 just as well as larger headphone amps I\\'ve seen in the sub-$300 price range. Sound quality is fantastic, there\\'s insanely low noise floor to boot, it works with iOS and macOS, supports lossless audio of course, and is just... awesomely tiny.\\n', '00:08:10 - 00:10:10: Moving to tiny things my wife loves... this micro ratchet wrench—I love it too! This thing is just 2\" long—like my pinkie. Any 1/4\" bit slips inside and can be ratcheted both left and right. It\\'s so small, it can basically be used as a screwdriver and in instances where you just don\\'t have clearance, well, stick the 1/4 bit in the opposite end and now you\\'ve got a stubby screwdriver. I\\'ve been keeping this with some bits in an Altoids tin in my backpack and it\\'s fabulously handy. I don\\'t like things on my phone so when Moft\\'s tripod stand was suggested to me by Joel, I knew I\\'d hate it. Well folks, I knew wrong—this thing is sweet. It snaps onto the back of your phone and unfolds in a cascading origami structure. You can set it up in a variety of different ways making it useful for vlogging, for video calls when using Continuity Camera, when watching movies, as a tripod for group photos and more. It\\'s light, way thinner than you\\'d think given its capabilities, and I love it—even if the price is a bit tough to swallow. Last year I mentioned Omnifixo, the perfect helping-hands companion for soldering. Many asked what iron I\\'d recommend for those new to soldering but I didn\\'t have an answer—at least not until I ordered a Pinecil earlier this year. This $26 soldering iron is incredible and punches way above its price tag. For starters, its entirely open-source and runs a risc-five CPU. Why on earth would you need this? Well, it gives you precise temperature control on the OLED display between 100 and 450 degrees celsius, it can reach said temperature in just 6 seconds, and automatically enters standby as soon as the on-board accelerometer stops detecting motion. You\\n', \"00:10:17 - 00:12:17: can use Pinecil's shorty-tips or any standardized TS-100 tip to get more precision—dependent on your soldering application, and while you've seen me using it thus far with a DC barrel jack, the Pinecil even supports USB-C PD! This thing is amazing and blows the door off of any other sub-$75 soldering iron. For literally 26 bucks. Buying one is basically legal theft. Ya know, not every gift has to be new and if you're running a Mac without a versioned or restorable backup, shame on you—especially since you can get an old Apple Time Capsule on eBay for less than $30. I got mine for $20 with a dead hard drive, and I was able to easily swap out the cheapo stock drive with a 2TB SATA SSD I bought from Amazon for $70. It's amazing how cheap SSDs have become. Now, the Time Capsule when released acted as a router and WiFi access point but I don't want either of those enabled because this thing is old... So, to make this a NAS, we're going to use an Ethernet cable from our router or switch and plug it into the WAN port on the Time Capsule.

Gather round for legitimately cool gadgets you probably haven\\'t heard of—some of my favorites, and some of yours too. Oh, and save for one product, none of these are sponsored. I hate the multi-monitor lifestyle, but I do find myself wanting to place a static window on a smaller display—with the hilariously named Kwumsy K3, I can! This thing is an RGB mechanical keyboard, laptop I/O hub, SSD enclosure, and 13\" touchscreen—all in one. Supply it power, data, and video from your laptop or desktop and you\\'re off to the races. You\\'ve got access to the fairly bandwith-limited but still capable 5Gbps throughput for other USB devices, SD cards, and even an M.2-sized SSD. The keyboard is nice with surprisingly fancy double-shot PBT caps and less fancy generic yellow MX-style switches. That said, the switches are solderless so you can use the included tool to pop them right out and substitute your preferred combo. Neato. The screen is 1920x720 and has a luminance of 300 nits. It’s not fantastic—viewing angles are less than superb—but when angled right, looks better than the specs may suggest and having the ability to use it at any angle makes it the perfect 10-point multitouch sketch pad for Windows, a suitable social feed for macOS, and even a cyberdeck console for Raspberry Pi. All of us carry a flashlight around with us every day, but a smartphone is a pretty lousy one—this is the Aurora A8. It\\'s a teeny-tiny LED flashlight that brightens to an insane 650 lumens. Don\\'t know how bright that is? Well, here\\'s an iPhone 15 Pro,'), (datetime.datetime(1900, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1), datetime.datetime(1900, 1, 1, 0, 4, 1), \"and here's this little flashlight. Yeah, not only does the single button toggle through brightness settings, but it also has a UV light onboard to inspect currency and sketchy hotel rooms, it has a red light great for use when dark without losing night vision, it can flash if you have it attached to a backpack to alert cars of your presence, and it has a flood light to illuminate an area like a tent. It runs for hours on its internal battery, charges via USB-C, and comes with a clip, keyring, and magnetic base to attach to basically anything. It's amazing. If you're a 90s kid that grew up on Bop-It like I did, you'll love Flipslide. This cheap puzzle game has you flip and slide colored tiles to match those displayed on-screen. What sounds simple gets really intense with a variety of game modes from a simon-says-style mode to level mode which gives you increasingly less time as you progress and even multiplayer mode that had my wife and I laughing hysterically. It's perfect to play alone or with friends and priced the way it is, it's impossible to say no to. Get it. You should also get the Dyad Pro and S8 Pro Ultra from today's sponsor, Roborock. You may recall Roborock sponsored last year's gift guide—I personally sought them out to sponsor again this year because I love their products so much. The Dyad Pro is a cordless wet-dry vacuum that handles basically anything you can throw at it. Multiple brush rollers underneath the device wet and scrub your floor free of sticky, stainy grime within 1mm of walls and the powerful 17,000 pascal motor sucks up all of the waste—both wet and dry. The onboard DirTech smart sensor analyzes grime concentration on the rollers and adjusts water flow and suction accordingly to handle all tasks. Most wet-dry vacs are more hassle than they're worth, but not the Dyad Pro because\"), (datetime.datetime(1900, 1, 1, 0, 4, 6), datetime.datetime(1900, 1, 1, 0, 6, 6), \"upon returning it to its dock it self-cleans and hot-air dries the entire system making it ready day after day, week after week. There's even an onboard cleaning concentrate dispenser for scrubbing with surfactants, so you really only have to add clean water—and empty the dirty tank—when you feel like it. And the only thing better than a gadget that lessens work is one that removes it entirely—that's where the Roborock S8 Pro Ultra comes in. This vacuum is exceptional at its primary job—picking up debris—thanks to its dual-roller brush design and class-leading 6,000 pascal suction. This thing will get hair, crumbs, food, and more—from both hardwood and carpet. When the latter is detected, suction is boosted and the mop is raised so as to not touch rug and carpet fibers. Oh yeah, this thing mops too with its VibraRise system that scrubs the floor pretty aggressively removing a surprising amount of floor grime. When its finished its task, the bot returns to its all-in-one dock that empties the dust bin, washes the mop pad, hot-air dries said pad and station to avoid mildew, refills the on-board water tank, and charges the bot for its next journey. It's a great vacuum and mop, but the reason I've continued to use Roborock vacuums exclusively on the main floor of my home the past 4 years is the excellent, class-leading app and navigation system. Not only is it easy to issue commands and set schedules, but most importantly, my S8 Pro Ultra has vacuumed for nearly 200 hours since I got it earlier this year, and in the past month, it hasn't failed a route even once. It almost never gets stuck avoiding any obstacles placed before it, requires essentially zero maintenance, and keeps my floor clean for weeks before I have to think about lifting a finger. It's seriously one of the best tech gadgets I've ever owned—period. I love it and know you will too—be sure to check out\"), (datetime.datetime(1900, 1, 1, 0, 6, 6), datetime.datetime(1900, 1, 1, 0, 8, 6), 'the S8 Pro Ultra and Dyad Pro while their Black Friday deals are ongoing using the links below. ISDT is a brand known to anyone that pilots drones or RC cars as they make some of the best LiPo battery chargers on the market. What I didn\\'t know until recently is that they also make an absolute chungus 200W USB charger. This thing has 3 type-C PD ports that can deliver 65/65/and a highly unusual, but amazing 140W—maxing out even the 16\" M3 Max MacBook Pro under full load while fast charging. Furthermore, the lone USB-A port supports up to 24W with support for all protocols like Qualcomm QuickCharge. A handsome LCD display reads out the wattage being pushed to each device including to the wireless charging pad which uses an MFi-certified MagSafe puck that pushes the full 15W of wireless power the iPhone is capable of. Given that making chargers is literally ISDT\\'s bread-and-butter, I was unsurprised but pleased to see quiet active cooling and overheat protection triggers. There’s even an app—if you want such a thing—and it comes with 2 high-quality 240W-capable Type-C cables. For the price they’re asking, it’s a steal. Wired headphones are back in amongst the youth, I hear, and the Questyle M15 is a must-have HiFi accessory for any wired headphones-listener. It\\'s a USB-C powered DAC and headphone amp in an insanely tiny package. In years past, this small size would suggest lousy amplification capabilities, but no... this thing is nuts: it can power my super inefficient Audeze LCD-3 just as well as larger headphone amps I\\'ve seen in the sub-$300 price range. Sound quality is fantastic, there\\'s insanely low noise floor to boot, it works with iOS and macOS, supports lossless audio of course, and is just... awesomely tiny.'), (datetime.datetime(1900, 1, 1, 0, 8, 10), datetime.datetime(1900, 1, 1, 0, 10, 10), 'Moving to tiny things my wife loves... this micro ratchet wrench—I love it too! This thing is just 2\" long—like my pinkie. Any 1/4\" bit slips inside and can be ratcheted both left and right. It\\'s so small, it can basically be used as a screwdriver and in instances where you just don\\'t have clearance, well, stick the 1/4 bit in the opposite end and now you\\'ve got a stubby screwdriver. I\\'ve been keeping this with some bits in an Altoids tin in my backpack and it\\'s fabulously handy. I don\\'t like things on my phone so when Moft\\'s tripod stand was suggested to me by Joel, I knew I\\'d hate it. Well folks, I knew wrong—this thing is sweet. It snaps onto the back of your phone and unfolds in a cascading origami structure. You can set it up in a variety of different ways making it useful for vlogging, for video calls when using Continuity Camera, when watching movies, as a tripod for group photos and more. It\\'s light, way thinner than you\\'d think given its capabilities, and I love it—even if the price is a bit tough to swallow. Last year I mentioned Omnifixo, the perfect helping-hands companion for soldering. Many asked what iron I\\'d recommend for those new to soldering but I didn\\'t have an answer—at least not until I ordered a Pinecil earlier this year. This $26 soldering iron is incredible and punches way above its price tag. For starters, its entirely open-source and runs a risc-five CPU. Why on earth would you need this? Well, it gives you precise temperature control on the OLED display between 100 and 450 degrees celsius, it can reach said temperature in just 6 seconds, and automatically enters standby as soon as the on-board accelerometer stops detecting motion. You'), (datetime.datetime(1900, 1, 1, 0, 10, 17), datetime.datetime(1900, 1, 1, 0, 12, 17), \"can use Pinecil's shorty-tips or any standardized TS-100 tip to get more precision—dependent on your soldering application, and while you've seen me using it thus far with a DC barrel jack, the Pinecil even supports USB-C PD! This thing is amazing and blows the door off of any other sub-$75 soldering iron. For literally 26 bucks. Buying one is basically legal theft. Ya know, not every gift has to be new and if you're running a Mac without a versioned or restorable backup, shame on you—especially since you can get an old Apple Time Capsule on eBay for less than $30. I got mine for $20 with a dead hard drive, and I was able to easily swap out the cheapo stock drive with a 2TB SATA SSD I bought from Amazon for $70. It's amazing how cheap SSDs have become. Now, the Time Capsule when released acted as a router and WiFi access point but I don't want either of those enabled because this thing is old...

      "['00:00:00 - 00:02:00: Another year, another gift guide—without ', \"the expensive, sponsored crap you'll see everywhere else. Gather round for legitimately \", \"cool gadgets you probably haven't heard of—some of my favorites, and some of yours too. Oh, and \", 'save for one product, none of these are sponsored. I hate the multi-monitor lifestyle, but I do ', 'find myself wanting to place a static window on a smaller display—with the hilariously named ', 'Kwumsy K3, I can! This thing is an RGB mechanical keyboard, laptop I/O hub, SSD enclosure, and ', '13\" touchscreen—all in one. Supply it power, data, and video from your laptop or desktop ', \"and you're off to the races. You've got access to the fairly bandwith-limited but still capable \", '5Gbps throughput for other USB devices, SD cards, and even an M.2-sized SSD. The keyboard is nice ', 'with surprisingly fancy double-shot PBT caps and less fancy generic yellow MX-style switches. ', 'That said, the switches are solderless so you can use the included tool to pop them right out ', 'and substitute your preferred combo. Neato. The screen is 1920x720 and has a luminance of 300 ', 'nits. It’s not fantastic—viewing angles are less than superb—but when angled right, looks better ', 'than the specs may suggest and having the ability to use it at any angle makes it the perfect ', '10-point multitouch sketch pad for Windows, a suitable social feed for macOS, and ', 'even a cyberdeck console for Raspberry Pi. All of us carry a flashlight around with us ', \"every day, but a smartphone is a pretty lousy one—this is the Aurora A8. It's a teeny-tiny \", \"LED flashlight that brightens to an insane 650 lumens. Don't know how bright that \", \"is? Well, here's an iPhone 15 Pro, \", \"00:02:01 - 00:04:01: and here's this little flashlight. Yeah, not only \", 'does the single button toggle through brightness settings, but it also has a UV light onboard ', 'to inspect currency and sketchy hotel rooms, it has a red light great for use when dark ', 'without losing night vision, it can flash if you have it attached to a backpack to alert ', 'cars of your presence, and it has a flood light to illuminate an area like a tent. It runs for ', 'hours on its internal battery, charges via USB-C, and comes with a clip, keyring, and magnetic base ', \"to attach to basically anything. It's amazing. If you're a 90s kid that grew up on Bop-It \", \"like I did, you'll love Flipslide. This cheap puzzle game has you flip and slide \", 'colored tiles to match those displayed on-screen. What sounds simple gets really ', 'intense with a variety of game modes from a simon-says-style mode to level mode which gives ', 'you increasingly less time as you progress and even multiplayer mode that had my wife and I ', \"laughing hysterically. It's perfect to play alone or with friends and priced the way it \", \"is, it's impossible to say no to. Get it. You should also get the Dyad Pro and S8 Pro \", \"Ultra from today's sponsor, Roborock. You may recall Roborock sponsored last year's gift \", 'guide—I personally sought them out to sponsor again this year because I love their products so ', 'much. The Dyad Pro is a cordless wet-dry vacuum that handles basically anything you can throw at ', 'it. Multiple brush rollers underneath the device wet and scrub your floor free of sticky, stainy ', 'grime within 1mm of walls and the powerful 17,000 pascal motor sucks up all of the waste—both wet ', 'and dry. The onboard DirTech smart sensor analyzes grime concentration on the rollers and adjusts ', 'water flow and suction accordingly to handle all tasks. Most wet-dry vacs are more hassle than ', \"they're worth, but not the Dyad Pro because \", '00:04:06 - 00:06:06: upon returning it to its dock it self-cleans and ', \"hot-air dries the entire system making it ready day after day, week after week. There's even \", 'an onboard cleaning concentrate dispenser for scrubbing with surfactants, so you really only ', 'have to add clean water—and empty the dirty tank—when you feel like it. And the only thing ', \"better than a gadget that lessens work is one that removes it entirely—that's where the Roborock \", 'S8 Pro Ultra comes in. This vacuum is exceptional at its primary job—picking up debris—thanks to ', 'its dual-roller brush design and class-leading 6,000 pascal suction. This thing will get hair, ', 'crumbs, food, and more—from both hardwood and carpet. When the latter is detected, suction is ', 'boosted and the mop is raised so as to not touch rug and carpet fibers. Oh yeah, this thing mops ', 'too with its VibraRise system that scrubs the floor pretty aggressively removing a surprising ', 'amount of floor grime. When its finished its task, the bot returns to its all-in-one dock that ', 'empties the dust bin, washes the mop pad, hot-air dries said pad and station to avoid ', \"mildew, refills the on-board water tank, and charges the bot for its next journey. It's a great \", \"vacuum and mop, but the reason I've continued to use Roborock vacuums exclusively on the main floor \", 'of my home the past 4 years is the excellent, class-leading app and navigation system. Not only ', 'is it easy to issue commands and set schedules, but most importantly, my S8 Pro Ultra has ', 'vacuumed for nearly 200 hours since I got it earlier this year, and in the past month, it ', \"hasn't failed a route even once. It almost never gets stuck avoiding any obstacles placed before \", 'it, requires essentially zero maintenance, and keeps my floor clean for weeks before I have to ', \"think about lifting a finger. It's seriously one of the best tech gadgets I've ever owned—period. I \", 'love it and know you will too—be sure to check out ', '00:06:06 - 00:08:06: the S8 Pro Ultra and Dyad Pro while their Black ', 'Friday deals are ongoing using the links below. ISDT is a brand known to anyone that pilots ', 'drones or RC cars as they make some of the best LiPo battery chargers on the market. What I ', \"didn't know until recently is that they also make an absolute chungus 200W USB charger. This thing \", 'has 3 type-C PD ports that can deliver 65/65/and a highly unusual, but amazing 140W—maxing out even ', 'the 16\" M3 Max MacBook Pro under full load while fast charging. Furthermore, the lone USB-A port ', 'supports up to 24W with support for all protocols like Qualcomm QuickCharge. A handsome LCD display ', 'reads out the wattage being pushed to each device including to the wireless charging pad which uses ', 'an MFi-certified MagSafe puck that pushes the full 15W of wireless power the iPhone is capable ', \"of. Given that making chargers is literally ISDT's bread-and-butter, I was unsurprised \", 'but pleased to see quiet active cooling and overheat protection triggers. There’s even an ', 'app—if you want such a thing—and it comes with 2 high-quality 240W-capable Type-C cables. ', 'For the price they’re asking, it’s a steal. Wired headphones are back in amongst the ', 'youth, I hear, and the Questyle M15 is a must-have HiFi accessory for any wired ', \"headphones-listener. It's a USB-C powered DAC and headphone amp in an insanely tiny \", 'package. In years past, this small size would suggest lousy amplification capabilities, ', 'but no... this thing is nuts: it can power my super inefficient Audeze LCD-3 just as well as ', \"larger headphone amps I've seen in the sub-$300 price range. Sound quality is fantastic, \", \"there's insanely low noise floor to boot, it works with iOS and macOS, supports lossless \", 'audio of course, and is just... awesomely tiny.', '00:08:10 - 00:10:10: Moving to tiny things my wife loves... this micro ', 'ratchet wrench—I love it too! This thing is just 2\" long—like my pinkie. Any 1/4\" bit slips inside ', \"and can be ratcheted both left and right. It's so small, it can basically be used as a screwdriver \", \"and in instances where you just don't have clearance, well, stick the 1/4 bit in the opposite \", \"end and now you've got a stubby screwdriver. I've been keeping this with some bits in an Altoids \", \"tin in my backpack and it's fabulously handy. I don't like things on my phone so when Moft's \", \"tripod stand was suggested to me by Joel, I knew I'd hate it. Well folks, I knew wrong—this \", 'thing is sweet. It snaps onto the back of your phone and unfolds in a cascading origami ', 'structure. You can set it up in a variety of different ways making it useful for vlogging, ', 'for video calls when using Continuity Camera, when watching movies, as a tripod for group ', \"photos and more. It's light, way thinner than you'd think given its capabilities, and I love \", 'it—even if the price is a bit tough to swallow. Last year I mentioned Omnifixo, the perfect ', \"helping-hands companion for soldering. Many asked what iron I'd recommend for those new \", \"to soldering but I didn't have an answer—at least not until I ordered a Pinecil earlier this \", 'year. This $26 soldering iron is incredible and punches way above its price tag. For starters, ', 'its entirely open-source and runs a risc-five CPU. Why on earth would you need this? Well, it ', 'gives you precise temperature control on the OLED display between 100 and 450 degrees celsius, it ', 'can reach said temperature in just 6 seconds, and automatically enters standby as soon as the ', 'on-board accelerometer stops detecting motion. You ', \"00:10:17 - 00:12:17: can use Pinecil's shorty-tips or any standardized \", \"TS-100 tip to get more precision—dependent on your soldering application, and while you've seen \", 'me using it thus far with a DC barrel jack, the Pinecil even supports USB-C PD! This ', 'thing is amazing and blows the door off of any other sub-$75 soldering iron. For literally ', '26 bucks. Buying one is basically legal theft. Ya know, not every gift has to be new and if ', \"you're running a Mac without a versioned or restorable backup, shame on you—especially since \", 'you can get an old Apple Time Capsule on eBay for less than $30. I got mine for $20 with a dead ', 'hard drive, and I was able to easily swap out the cheapo stock drive with a 2TB SATA SSD I ', \"bought from Amazon for $70. It's amazing how cheap SSDs have become. Now, the Time Capsule when \", \"released acted as a router and WiFi access point but I don't want either of those enabled because \", \"this thing is old... So, to make this a NAS, we're going to use an Ethernet cable from our router or \", 'switch and plug it into the WAN port on the Time Capsule. Then, we open AirPort Utility on our Mac ', 'or iPhone, select our Time Capsule, go to Wireless and turn it off. Then, we go into the network tab ', \"and set it to off or bridge mode so it doesn't try to create its own subnet and give us double NAT \", 'issues. We can still use the Time Capsule as a switch for other devices, but more importantly, ', 'we can now setup Time Machine and have all Macs on our network create versioned backups. We ', \"can even use it as a shared file or media server. I'm taking this 2TB all-flash NAS home—I \", 'mean, for less than $100, how could I say no?', '00:12:19 - 00:14:19: Meghan is better with a kitchen knife than I am so ', 'she naturally hates single-use kitchen gadgets and when she saw I got the Dreamfarm Garject, she ', 'rolled her eyes; but then, I used it, and she said \"okay, that\\'s actually really sick.\" Take a ', 'garlic clove, or multiple—papery peels and all—and load it into the Garject. Then, close the handle ', 'and see the garlic pressed through the holes with ease to a minced consistency—just like a regular ', 'garlic press. But now watch... upon opening the handles back up, the built-in scraper flicks ', 'all of the gooey garlic into your dish. Then, hitting the eject button removes the paper from ', \"the press and its ready for the dishwasher. It's a brilliantly quick way to get through the \", 'stickiest, stinkiest part of your meal prep. Trust in the Germans to over-engineer the simplest ', \"hand-tool ever made—the screwdriver—with the WERA Kraftform Turbo. In its standard state, it's \", 'just a screwdriver with a really sloppy shaft, but press the button at the back of the ', \"screwdriver, and you'll enable turbo mode—a purely mechanical gear train that turns \", 'one rotation of the hand into 4 rotations of the shank. You can do this two handed ', 'or single-handed, but the end result is a lot less twisting while getting screws in and ', \"out a lot faster. Personally, I find this more effective than a ratcheting driver when I've \", \"got a lot of screws to burn through, though it doesn't have a ton of torque, so for tightening \", \"or loosening past a few pound feet, you'll want to push the button to re-enable standard driver \", \"mode. It's absurdly unnecessary and I love it. I travel light and while I love the tiny 30W \", \"bricks that exist nowadays, they scratch the heck out of everything in my bag, so I've defaulted to \", \"Nomad's Slim lineup of gallium nitride chargers. \", \"00:14:21 - 00:16:21: They've got a single-port 35W and two-port \", '65W model—both tiny and lightweight, but more importantly, flat. Not only does this help ', \"avoid the scratchy-scratchy, but it also pushes the weight of the charger inwards so it doesn't \", \"droop or fall out from loose, worn hotel outlets. I've owned my Playdate for a year-and-a-half, \", \"and they're now just finally finishing their pre-order shipments to the point where you can buy \", \"one and actually get it soon. It's a cute, little, yellow game console with a one-bit transflective \", \"LCD—there's no backlight here—so it's best viewed in the sun. I've never owned a literal one-bit \", 'screen before but I love it. Seeing the art style choices required to create the perception ', 'of \"white and black\" is super beautiful. In addition to USB-C, on-board WiFi, a rather decent ', 'speaker, and face buttons, it has a crank—which is silly but a fun mechanic in several of games ', \"that use it. So here's the thing... Playdate is very expensive at $199. Now, much of that cost \", 'goes towards software because it does include 24 games that are unlocked once per week, every week, ', 'for 12 weeks; and, nearly all of the games are built by famous devs. Many of them are amazing, a ', 'few are just fine, some are long and several are short. Even taking the included games library into ', \"account, $200 is still nuts. My brain and wallet commands me to hate thing, but I just can't. It's \", \"absolutely whimsical, the games are innovative, it's superb for quick 3-minute game sessions, and \", \"it's so tiny you can take it with you everywhere. \", \"00:16:25 - 00:18:25: The community behind it is passionate and there's \", 'an enormous catalog of really great additional games that have been released for cheap and even ', \"oftentimes free—through both the Playdate Catalog store and Itch.io. It's the antithesis of cutting \", \"edge to the point of being obnoxiously hipster, but I don't care—it's so much fun, I adore it, \", \"and have for the nearly 2 years I've owned it. I love my Fluke 115 multimeter—it has saved \", \"me from getting electrocuted a bunch of times. But for $225, it doesn't really DO that much. The \", \"Australian-developed Pokit Pro on the other hand, very much does. It's a tiny little multimeter \", \"pen that uses a smartphone as a display screen. If this sounds dumb to you, I agree, but here's \", \"the thing... it's not just a multimeter. It's also an oscilloscope and data logger. And this \", \"isn't just a dumb-bum oscilloscope either—you can use functions to check frequency, RMS, \", 'period, average, duty, and more. You can even establish triggers to choose when and how a ', \"signal is captured. With wireless multi-channel support through a single app, you're off to \", 'the races for multiple-probe support and the built-in data logger is also sweet... you can take ', 'electrical or even temperature measurements using the onboard thermistor or and external NTC probe ', 'over an extended period of time—up to 6 months—all logged on-device and synced to the mobile app at ', 'a later date. You can now even setup range testing wherein you can establish measurement thresholds ', 'to quickly and easily identify passing spec by LED color and buzzer without needing to use a phone ', 'or display at all. If Pokit Pro is a bit pricey for you, most of the features are available on the ', \"even smaller Pokit Meter that you can get for less than $100. I don't think anything in this \", 'price comes even close to feature-set or ', '00:18:28 - 00:20:28: size—and it more than makes up for having ', 'to awkwardly use a phone to see the data. If your significant other told you they bought ', 'a 9\" Unicorn Magnum Plus, what would you believe that to be? If you guessed a pepper mill, wow, ', \"you're weird—but also, correct. The market is being flooded with nonsense $150+ salt and pepper \", 'mills made from machined aluminum and lemme tell you what: they suck compared to this ugly, plastic ', 'USA-made treasure. Compare the Magnum to my cheap but dependable OXO radial grinder or bougie ', 'Cole and Mason mill, and it disgraces their very existence. The Magnum can crack out a teaspoon ', 'of pepper with just 6 rotations. It makes so much pepper that it almost makes too much pepper. There ', \"isn't much in the way of fine granular control, but it doesn't matter because you can't \", 'expect to tame 9\" hog. The Magnum sprays its love everywhere and you\\'d be lucky to own ', \"one. Seriously... they're almost always sold out. When I first saw the Kinipex Cobra xtra-small \", 'pliers, I thought they were joke pliers. Like... seriously... these are tiny. What on earth could ', 'they be useful for? Dude... so many things. Despite being a mere 4\", there are 11 adjustment ', \"positions that open past 1 and 1/8ths inch—or... 28mm if you're scared of fractions and freedom. \", \"Now, the shorter handles don't give you insane leverage, but you get more than you need for most \", 'applications and the crazy number of adjustment positions in addition to the long jaw-tip length ', 'lets them often pull double-duty as an adjustable wrench. While you lack cutters, the pipe grips are ', \"sharp as all get out and bite into anything. These are German—and we already established they don't \", 'mess around. I think the perfect gift is something ', \"00:20:29 - 00:22:29: that's just pricey enough you probably wouldn't \", \"buy it on your own volition but something you'd use all the time if received—at $30, these \", 'weirdo little pliers are that. End of story. And end of video—if you enjoyed this, please do ', 'give it a like. If you wanna pick something up, use the links in the description to ', \"send a small affiliate kick-back to Snazzy Labs if you don't mind—if \", \"you do mind and don't want to, that's okay too.

      "Captions representation: '00:00:00 - 00:02:00: - All right, so this is the Humane AI Pin. It is a brand new product, and a really, really\\ninteresting form factor of an ultra futuristic wearable computer. So in a time of all these\\ncrazy gadgets and Vision Pro, and wearable glasses, it\\'s so sick that we get so many genuinely new first\\ngeneration products like this to give a shot. Unfortunately, it\\'s also\\nthe new worst product I think I\\'ve ever reviewed,\\nin its current state. There\\'s just so many things bad about it. It\\'s so bad, in fact, that I think it\\'s actually\\nkind of distracting to like understand what\\nthe point of the device is as we go through it. So I\\'m gonna have to separate\\nit out for this video. First, I\\'m gonna tell you what it is, and what it\\'s supposed to do, and then I\\'ll tell you what my experience has actually been using it. (mellow instrumental music) So this thing is a\\nsmall, wearable computer, with an AI inside, that can help you throughout your day. It\\'s about the size of a large watch. It has a camera and a microphone, and can interact with\\nthe world around you. But in case you can\\'t use that as input, there\\'s also a touch pad\\nand a projector inside, with this super new\\nstyle of gesture control, with the projection on your hand. It costs $700, plus... A $24 a month subscription plan for the data that comes with it, and all the services and\\nall the online storage. But yeah, $700, plus a subscription. It\\'s already a fun start. So one of the big things off the top is, this does not pair to\\nyour smartphone at all. This is its own standalone device, with its own internet connection, with its own phone number. And so this little AI assistant just goes everywhere with\\nyou, it\\'s always connected, and that\\'s... You can choose how much\\nor how little to use it alongside your smartphone.\\n00:02:02 - 00:04:02: So you know, on its face, maybe that\\'s kind of\\na cool idea, at least. Like the idea is you\\ntalk to it like a person, it answers questions, it\\ngives you historical facts, or personalized recommendations, or helps you out with things, like brainstorming or remembering things. It can make phone calls,\\nand send text messages. A ton of stuff. The unfortunate reality though, is this thing is too much of a pain to use to actually want to do most of that stuff alongside your phone. But we\\'ll get there. (mellow instrumental music) All right, let me actually\\nstart with the hardware. This little thing, the\\nbuild of this thing, is actually impressive. Like genuinely, I think if\\nyou\\'re looking for a reason to feel like you\\'re\\nnot getting ripped off, the hardware packaging actually\\nkind of accomplishes that. Like this pin is solid, it\\'s\\naluminum, it\\'s dense feeling. There\\'s three colors, actually. There\\'s all matte black,\\nwhich is the cheapest one. Or for a hundred bucks more, you can get white or\\nthis black and silver one that I\\'m using. And then there\\'s a lot of\\nsensors packed up there. There\\'s a camera, there\\'s\\nmicrophones, there\\'s lights, there\\'s a tiny class 2 laser projector. So this whole thing is\\nlike really densely packed. And then the magnets also\\nthat connect everything, are super strong. So the back of this pin\\nis called a \"booster\". It\\'s another battery. So it\\'s got its own internal battery, but then once you attach\\nit to your clothes, it cleverly, through your\\nclothes, magnetizes there. It makes a nice sound when you do. And that\\'s how you get it attached. So you get two of these boosters. And since there\\'s the internal battery, you can literally hot swap between them so the thing stays alive. Very clever. And then it also comes with\\nthis extremely well-made, and also very, very\\nreflective charging case. So you can pop it in there,\\nor just your battery in there, keep it topped off. That charges by USB Type-C. This thing is nice. And it also comes with this\\nlike desktop charging puck, where you can magnetize in the battery, or the whole thing. The pin and the booster at the same time. So that is a lot of charging and battery related accessories, but they all come with it.\\n00:04:03 - 00:06:03: And this pin, you know, it\\'s also got these\\nlights up at the top here that light up anytime\\nyou\\'re doing anything. And there\\'s also a small\\npin light notification for when there\\'s\\nsomething waiting for you. So between the weight of the parts and the strength of the magnets,\\nhow it all slaps together, like you can tell that a lot of effort was put into the\\ncraftsmanship of this product, which I very much appreciate. It\\'s the best part of the pin, by a lot. (mellow instrumental music) Okay, I want you to forget\\nabout the smartphone in your pocket for a second. Like just for a minute, just\\npretend that doesn\\'t exist. Ignore it, right? This little pin can do a lot\\nof stuff, and is very helpful. So again, think of this\\nthing as an AI assistant that\\'s like by your side,\\nall the time with you. So, you can ask it things. It doesn\\'t have a wake word, it only turns the mic on and\\nlistens when you touch it. So you can go... (AI Pin beeps) How tall is the Empire State Building? (AI Pin beeps) And then when you let go, it starts sending that\\nquery off to the crowd. The- - [AI Pin] The Empire State Building is 1,454 feet tall to the tip. - The Cloud. And then gets you an\\nanswer, which is great. And it also is multimodal. So that means it can look at the camera, and see things, and interact\\nwith the world around you. So... (AI Pin beeps) Look and tell me what you see. (AI Pin beeps) So it\\'ll scan the room,\\nuse the Cloud again. That little noise was it\\ntaking a little image, sending AI image to the Cloud, analyzing it, getting it back, then deciding what to tell me. - [AI Pin] You are sitting in front of a camera and a laptop. The camera is on a tripod\\nand pointed at you. The laptop is open, and\\nyou are looking at it. There are three pictures of\\ndogs on the wall behind you. There is a window to\\nthe left of the camera. There is a boom mic on\\nthe table in front of you. There is a red carpet on the floor. - Great. The camera can also take pictures, or up to 15 second videos, which it auto uploads while charging. It can also remember things\\nyou tell it to remember. And all these things will\\nshow up in the Humane Center. So it\\'s like this online web portal\\n00:06:05 - 00:08:05: for all things connected to the pin. There\\'s no app, it\\'s just the website. So there, you can see a whole\\nhistory of who you\\'ve called, and texted, and what you\\'ve listened to, and what answers it gave to\\nyour most recent requests, and all the things you\\ntold it to remember. It is pretty well-rounded. I think probably its best\\ntech demo feature though, is the translate back and forth. You got a two finger\\ngesture, you can go... (AI Pin beeps) (Marques speaks in Spanish) (AI Pin beeps) - [AI Pin] Where\\'s the library? - So it auto detects the language,\\ntranslates it to English, and the person who speaks\\nback can translate back, as long as you hold on the\\npin and listen to them. Pretty cool. This is all voice stuff though. So if at any point you\\'re in a loud area, or a very private area, and you don\\'t wanna interact\\nout loud with your voice, that\\'s where this projector comes in. So it seems crazy, but\\nyou activate it like that, and then you just hold your\\nfinger out, your whole palm, and it becomes a projector screen for the laser projector\\nbuilt into the pin. So it takes a little practice, but eventually you get used\\nto holding your hand up in just the right spot, and then the UI gets\\nprojected in this green 720p mini screen on your hand. So you basically use your hand, try to be as flat as possible, and then to interact with it, there are some movement gestures. So there\\'s a time of flight sensor that keeps track of movement, and you move your hand around kind of like rolling a marble around in\\nyour hand to select something, then pinch to select. You can then make a fist to go back, and then you literally push forward to move deeper into a menu. So this is like a 3D UI you have to learn. This is obviously very\\nbrand new for people, but I think to be fair,\\nit is pretty intuitive. I think if you get a\\nquick 60 second lesson, you kind of already have\\nlearned all the things you need. When you first connect\\nthe booster to the pin, you can unlock it, and\\nunlocking it with my pin, is like this... Move your hand through space\\nto select the numbers thing. It\\'s literally like moving back and forth through a Rolodex of real numbers. So it\\'s one of those like\\nborderline magic things where the first time you see it, you kind of just get it, and it clicks.\\n00:08:07 - 00:10:07: Even if it is a little fidgety, and a little bit inaccurate\\nand kind of slow. But that gets us into the review. (mellow instrumental music) So, unfortunately... This thing is bad at\\nalmost everything it does, basically all the time. Where do I even start? So I guess first of all, okay, it\\'s supposed to just\\nanswer questions, right? It can kinda do that sometimes,\\nbut one, it\\'s often slow, because most of these requests go to the Cloud and come back, and there\\'s just a long wait. And two, it\\'s often wrong, because AI still can hallucinate, and there are still issues with it just not understanding correctly, or just saying the wrong thing. And that\\'s not even\\nmentioning server timeouts, if you have a poor internet connection, which happens to me all\\nthe time in this studio. So when they do most of the demos, like on their websites\\nand in their videos, they\\'ll ask a question,\\nand then they\\'ll let go, and keep talking to fill the silence, so it\\'s not awkward as\\nyou wait for an answer, and realize how long it is. But even on this fast studio wifi here... (AI Pin beeps) Who designed the Washington Monument? (AI Pin beeps) - [AI] Finding designer. The Washington Monument was\\ndesigned by Robert Mills, a prominent 19th century\\nAmerican architect from South Carolina. The construction was\\neventually completed by- - Okay. So you can just hold your hand up to put your answer on your hand, and interrupt that it\\'s talking so much. But even that was like a\\npretty good performance for the AI Pin. In ideal, fast wifi conditions. But there are many, many times when I feel like it\\'s way slower, and it seems like it goes to the internet for almost everything. I mean there\\'s a few queries I guess might be local, like... (AI Pin beeps) What time is it? (AI Pin beeps) - [AI Pin] 11:42 AM. - Like that\\'s pretty fast. If I ask the battery life, it can tell me that pretty fast. But it feels like\\nbasically everything else is just shoveling it off to the Cloud, not computing on the device,\\nand it takes a while. But it\\'s also just wrong all the time.\\n00:10:09 - 00:12:09: Like, I remember asking it\\ndays before the solar eclipse when the next eclipse\\nwas, and it said 2044. I asked it, \"What\\'s some\\ngood Asian food in the area?\" And over and over again it thought I said, \"What\\'s the best ash?\" For some reason? When is the next Nets game? (AI Pin beeps) - [AI Pin] Finding next Nets game. The next Brooklyn Nets game\\nis on Sunday, April 14th, but no specific opponent\\nor location is provided. - I just Googled it. It says it\\'s the 76ers,\\nso that\\'s kind of weird. (AI Pin beeps) What\\'s the traffic to the\\nEmpire State Building from here? (AI Pin beeps) - [AI Pin] Finding direction. Use the voice command feature of AI Pin to ask for traffic information to the Empire State Building, and it will provide you\\nwith the details you need. - I did? This stuff happens all the time. But then, speaking of battery life... Really bad. (Marques laughs) And inconsistent, which is annoying. So, it\\'s already kind of bad enough that you have another device, that you also have to\\ncharge every single day. But with this, it\\'s\\nactually more than that. You have to constantly\\nbabysit the battery, and swap out boosters\\nand charge this thing, and keep it charged\\nmultiple times per day. So like I said before, you get two of these\\nthings that come with it, and I\\'ve had a pin nuke through\\nthe entire booster battery in two hours, while not\\nreally doing much of anything. I\\'ve also had it last like four hours while doing a whole bunch of, you know, photos and videos and\\nrequests and laser stuff. And it\\'s also just like constantly warm the whole time. Just all the time. Which is a little bit concerning. I\\'ll also say, multiple\\ntimes in various situations, I\\'ve had it just overheat\\nfor seemingly no reason, and tell me to wait a\\nwhile for it to cool down. I think the heat problem is also amplified because of the gap\\ncreated by whatever fabric is between the booster and the product,\\n00:12:11 - 00:14:11: that it is actively, inductively charging. You know, it is a lot of\\nvery impressive engineering, but wireless charging is\\nnotoriously inefficient, and loses energy via heat, and that\\'s what\\'s happening\\nin here all the time. So just the fact that it\\'s warm, just this warm puck on my chest all day, was just enough to never quite\\nforget that I\\'m wearing it. Well, that and the weight. Look, it\\'s well-made, like I said, it\\'s really impressive hardware, but it\\'s just a little... I mean, you see that little sag? It\\'s just a little too heavy, in the same way that Vision\\nPro is just a bit too heavy. When you\\'re wearing the thing, you just wanna make it\\nas light as possible. It\\'s why a lot of this\\nstuff is made of plastic. So when you decide to go\\naluminum instead, yeah, it\\'s just a little too heavy. I feel like Humane in\\na lot of their videos, they\\'ve got all these thick\\nfabrics, and like heavy jackets, so it doesn\\'t really pull\\ndown and sag nearly as much. But if you wear some lighter\\nweight materials like I do, especially when it gets warm outside, this is really gonna start to be noticed. And yes, there are some\\noptional accessories that are lighter weight, but you never quite forget about it. This pin cannot set a timer. This pin cannot set an alarm. This notification light they\\nput up at the corner here, it\\'s there and it works, but it is basically out of my\\nperipheral, my field of use, so I almost never see it. And you know, they also chose\\nthis corner for the light, which means it\\'s designed to be worn on this half of the body, which is fine, and you\\nget used to it there, but that\\'s also exactly\\nwhere most seat belts go, in the US anyway. So, not their fault, just another annoying\\nthing about using it. The photos look pretty bad, and the videos look even worse. They\\'re square-ish in\\naspect ratio, very noisy, and they max out at 15 seconds. The hub that everything\\nsyncs with, for me, just randomly stops working, and I have to refresh it\\nto get it to work again. The projector... As impressive as a technical\\nachievement as it is, it\\'s just not very readable. It\\'s not particularly bright outdoors, and it gets dimmer the\\nfurther from your hand it is\\n00:14:13 - 00:16:13: because of physics. And unless I knew what\\nthose words were saying, I really can\\'t read very much. And... (Marques chuckles) There are no apps. There just are no apps. So when you first sign up\\nwith your Humane account, you get to sync with four accounts. There are your Apple,\\nGoogle, Microsoft, and Tidal. So the first three are\\nbasically for your contacts, and then the last one, Tidal\\nis the exclusive music partner. So there is no Uber access, there is no Spotify access,\\nthere\\'s no WhatsApp, there\\'s no calendar, no\\nGmail, none of that stuff. It\\'s just... I can\\'t book a flight, I\\ncan\\'t buy something on Amazon. It just will not do any of that stuff that I just do on my phone. (mellow instrumental music) So I know I\\'ve said like\\na bunch of the downsides and the problems this device has, but I really genuinely\\nthink the biggest problem this pin is going to have, is that smartphones are kind of OP. The number one thing I\\'ve reminded myself from the week of using this pin, trying to get it to do stuff, is that smartphones are not\\ngoing anywhere anytime soon. And I think a lot of the comments online have already picked up on this, even without testing and\\nusing the pin, which is, okay, there seems like a lot of overlap between what this is and\\nwhat a smartphone can do. But everything that this pin does, a modern smartphone\\ndoes better and faster, and easier and in higher quality, and just better in every way. Like your smartphone obviously takes better pictures and videos, and you can frame things more easily. Of course, a phone can call\\nand text people more easily. You can use it in more\\nplaces, loud places, private places, use it\\nwith literally any outfit. Also, a phone, like you\\ncan quickly Google things, it\\'s faster to message people back. And of course, it can email people, and use all kinds of app experiences.\\n00:16:15 - 00:18:15: Do you know what happens\\nwhen you try to just send someone a picture from the AI Pin? You already know how\\nto do it on your phone. With the AI Pin, okay,\\nyou take the picture, then you either try this with your voice, or you pull up the picture, which is just a green\\n720p jpeg on your hand. I guess that\\'s a good\\nenough preview, sure. You go to send it, you pick your contact, or type in the whole phone\\nnumber with the gestures. Eventually, you go to send, and it has its own internet connection, and it sends a link to view the picture in the Humane web portal. Like the difference in how easy, how frictionless that is here versus here, it\\'s not even close. And there are honestly many times where I\\'d be trusting this pin, like I\\'m reviewing it,\\nI\\'m living that life, I\\'m using it, and I\\'d ask it something, and I would wait so long, and my phone would just\\nbe sitting right there, where I could just pick it\\nup and Google the answer in the time it takes me to get hopefully the right answer on the pin. It\\'s just... Phones are OP. (AI Pin beeps) Look and tell me what this is. (AI Pin beeps) Or I\\'ll just do this, I guess. Ah... It\\'s a Cybertruck. - [AI Pin] The photo is of a Cybertruck. An electric pickup\\ntruck produced by Tesla. - Yup. Also, I gotta say, when\\nI say phones are OP, like screens in your hand. So sick. Just for the last like 10% of any UI, like you can get almost all the way there with just your voice interaction. But let\\'s say you call an Uber, and you say, \"Take me to\\nthe studio from an Uber.\" Even if it could do that, which it can\\'t, but let\\'s say it could. And as you\\'re waiting, you\\'re like, \"I\\'m gonna just go grab a snack from this Starbucks on the corner.\" How do you adjust your\\npickup location with this?\\n00:18:17 - 00:20:17: Ugh. Just that friction of, I could just do it in\\ntwo seconds on my phone. Or buying something online is another one. I\\'ve seen a lot of demos\\nwhere someone\\'s like, \"Plan me a trip to Europe. Plan me an expedition.\" I don\\'t even wanna buy\\ndetergent online on this, because I need to check all\\nthe ratings and the titles, and make sure I\\'m ordering the right one. I do not trust that with just my voice. But I think most critically,\\nfor the AI assistant part... I actually love the idea\\nof a virtual assistant that you can talk to like a human. Like this is something\\nwe\\'ve been chasing for years with Google Assistant, and Siri and Alexa. And now with this new\\nform factor of, you know, a little AI in a box that\\ncan be with you everywhere, maybe that can deliver even\\nbetter on that specific promise, But the thing about a good assistant is it needs to know everything about you. That\\'s even true with a human assistant. Like, it needs to know your schedule, it needs to know where you go every day, it needs to know who you talk to, who your preferences are\\npersonally and for products. Like it needs to know\\neverything about you. And your smartphone already\\nknows a lot of things about you. But this is a standalone device that doesn\\'t talk to your phone, and so it doesn\\'t know any\\nof the things about you that your phone knows. So just from that, it\\'s already at such\\na massive disadvantage for the smartphone for being helpful. I mean, you can do what I did. Fully immerse yourself\\nfor several days straight, and tell it to remember everything, and call people, text people from it, but it will always have that gap. And that\\'s not even\\nmentioning this, like I said, it has its own phone number, and so if you text people\\nand call people from this, yeah, it can summarize all of\\nyour messages from the day, and all that stuff from\\nthese conversations, but it doesn\\'t see any\\nof these conversations. So if you\\'re texting here, this is not the same thread. That gap is always gonna be there. So I guess that begs the question, why didn\\'t they just make\\nthis connect to your phone?\\n00:20:21 - 00:22:21: Everyone has a phone. That\\'s the question that I think a lot of people are wondering. And I think... This is my theory, but I\\nthink Humane wants this thing to eventually be a very powerful\\nstandalone device someday. And in order to get it to that future, they can\\'t set the precedent now of connecting it to your\\nphone, \\'cause then that means they have to remove that\\nfeature in the future, and they don\\'t wanna do that. So this device as it exists today is hamstrung by its ideal\\nfuture version of itself. It\\'s like Vision Pro. Like I talked about it\\nin the Vision Pro review. It doesn\\'t actually pair\\nto your iPhone in any way. It\\'s its own standalone computer. And of course, Apple sees down the road, that could just be like a\\nlittle pair of smart glasses. You don\\'t need an iPhone to use that. But now, today, this thing is a victim of its future ambition. (mellow instrumental music) It was really hard to come up\\nwith a title for this video, but I will say, at one point, my working title for this was, \"This product is either\\nthe dumbest thing ever, or I\\'m an idiot.\" Because yes, it\\'s really,\\nreally, really, really bad now. But every once in a\\nwhile, and I mean a while, I would use it, and it would do exactly what\\nit\\'s supposed to do quickly, and I\\'d get it. And I\\'d really feel like that\\'s\\nhow it\\'s supposed to feel, and I\\'d do another request, and it would remind me of reality. But here\\'s an example, right? I\\'ve said a thousand times, like, my best ideas, golden rule, they always show up when\\nI can\\'t write them down. Like when I\\'m about to fall asleep, or I\\'m in the shower, or driving, right? So I\\'m using the pin, I\\'m driving to the studio\\nand I have an idea. I\\'m not trying to write\\nit down on my phone while driving or pull over, but I had the pin, so\\nI\\'m driving and I just... (AI Pin beeps) \"Remind me of this cool ABC outro idea\\n00:22:22 - 00:24:22: for the Humane review.\" (AI Pin beeps) And I just kept driving. And it wrote it down, and it saved it. - [AI Pin] Saving memory. - And when I go check the Humane- - [AI Pin] The outro idea\\nfor the Humane review has been saved. - The voice is kind of annoying. But now that\\'s up in the Humane AI Center, so when I arrive at the studio, that thing that I told it to remember, is sitting there waiting for me. That was nice. Or the other thing, the\\nunique first person videos. I could put it in the center\\nof my chest, and take videos. I would never want to\\ndistract myself while driving taking a video, but you know, even though the quality\\'s not great, that\\'s the most frictionless\\nversion of that, along with smart glasses. That\\'s great. And I think number one,\\non top of all of this, is if you ask me like, \"Who should buy this device right now?\" I mean, nobody should buy\\nthis device right now. But if there\\'s one person\\nwho would most consider it, it\\'s the person that wants to spend as little time as possible\\nwith a screen in their hands. Like as little time as\\npossible on their phone. And that\\'s me sometimes. I don\\'t wanna doom scroll the second I pull my\\nphone out of my pocket. For that person, if they want that at the\\nexpense of everything else, this device represents just a glimmer of hope for that future. Now the problem, of course,\\nis with this device, there\\'s just so much more\\nfriction and fumbling and annoyance that comes with it, that you don\\'t wanna do it, even though you would accomplish the goal of less screen time and\\nliving in the moment. But yeah, that\\'s the issue with it. I literally had a moment, like we did a shoot in Ohio the other day, which was like a travel day. And I woke up in the\\nmorning and I thought like, \"I don\\'t want to deal\\nwith this pin today.\" Like I have driving, so the\\nseat belt\\'s gonna be annoying, and then we\\'re gonna go to the airport, and then probably gotta take it off through the metal detector\\nand then put it on again, which means I have to log\\nin with the pin again and... Just all this, and I just was like, \"I don\\'t wanna have to\\ncharge this seven times. Like , I don\\'t wanna wear it today.\" So I skipped it. And you should probably\\nskip this product too. And never buy a product based on the future\\npromise of updates to it.\\n00:24:23 - 00:26:23: Obviously, this is a product\\nthat has a long way to go, and there\\'s a team behind it. And look, I gotta say,\\nas a brand new product, and a team trying to make something new... That, I respect. I respect the attempt. Because we don\\'t get a\\nlot of totally new stuff. But yeah, this has a long way to go. They do have a roadmap, actually. I\\'ll say. They\\'ve shared it. There\\'s some decent stuff on there, including number sharing, but that also has no date\\nand no other information. So I\\'ll just say, good luck. Godspeed. Thanks for watching. Catch you in the next one. Peace. (calming steel drum music fades)\\n'\n",

      "microphones, there's lights, there's a tiny class 2 laser projector. So this whole thing is\n",
      "like really densely packed. And then the magnets also\n",
      "that connect everything, are super strong. So the back of this pin\n",
      "is called a \"booster\". It's another battery. So it's got its own internal battery, but then once you attach\n",
      "it to your clothes, it cleverly, through your\n",
      "clothes, magnetizes there. It makes a nice sound when you do. And that's how you get it attached. So you get two of these boosters. And since there's the internal battery, you can literally hot swap between them so the thing stays alive. Very clever. And then it also comes with\n",
      "this extremely well-made, and also very, very\n",

      "\n",
      "Captions after[\"00:00:00 - 00:02:00: - All right, so this is the Humane AI Pin. It is a brand new product, and a really, really interesting form factor of an ultra futuristic wearable computer. So in a time of all these crazy gadgets and Vision Pro, and wearable glasses, it's so sick that we get so many genuinely new first generation products like this to give a shot. Unfortunately, it's also the new worst product I think I've ever reviewed, in its current state. There's just so many things bad about it. It's so bad, in fact, that I think it's actually kind of distracting to like understand what the point of the device is as we go through it. So I'm gonna have to separate it out for this video. First, I'm gonna tell you what it is, and what it's supposed to do, and then I'll tell you what my experience has actually been using it. (mellow instrumental music) So this thing is a small, wearable computer, with an AI inside, that can help you throughout your day. It's about the size of a large watch. It has a camera and a microphone, and can interact with the world around you. But in case you can't use that as input, there's also a touch pad and a projector inside, with this super new style of gesture control, with the projection on your hand. It costs $700, plus... A $24 a month subscription plan for the data that comes with it, and all the services and all the online storage. But yeah, $700, plus a subscription. It's already a fun start. So one of the big things off the top is, this does not pair to your smartphone at all. This is its own standalone device, with its own internet connection, with its own phone number. And so this little AI assistant just goes everywhere with you, it's always connected, and that's... You can choose how much or how little to use it alongside your smartphone.\\n\", '00:02:02 - 00:04:02: So you know, on its face, maybe that\\'s kind of a cool idea, at least. Like the idea is you talk to it like a person, it answers questions, it gives you historical facts, or personalized recommendations, or helps you out with things, like brainstorming or remembering things. It can make phone calls, and send text messages. A ton of stuff. The unfortunate reality though, is this thing is too much of a pain to use to actually want to do most of that stuff alongside your phone. But we\\'ll get there. (mellow instrumental music) All right, let me actually start with the hardware. This little thing, the build of this thing, is actually impressive. Like genuinely, I think if you\\'re looking for a reason to feel like you\\'re not getting ripped off, the hardware packaging actually kind of accomplishes that. Like this pin is solid, it\\'s aluminum, it\\'s dense feeling. There\\'s three colors, actually. There\\'s all matte black, which is the cheapest one. Or for a hundred bucks more, you can get white or this black and silver one that I\\'m using. And then there\\'s a lot of sensors packed up there. There\\'s a camera, there\\'s microphones, there\\'s lights, there\\'s a tiny class 2 laser projector. So this whole thing is like really densely packed. And then the magnets also that connect everything, are super strong. So the back of this pin is called a \"booster\". It\\'s another battery. So it\\'s got its own internal battery, but then once you attach it to your clothes, it cleverly, through your clothes, magnetizes there. It makes a nice sound when you do. And that\\'s how you get it attached. So you get two of these boosters. And since there\\'s the internal battery, you can literally hot swap between them so the thing stays alive. Very clever. And then it also comes with this extremely well-made, and also very, very reflective charging case. So you can pop it in there, or just your battery in there, keep it topped off. That charges by USB Type-C. This thing is nice. And it also comes with this like desktop charging puck, where you can magnetize in the battery, or the whole thing. The pin and the booster at the same time. So that is a lot of charging and battery related accessories, but they all come with it.\\n', \"00:04:03 - 00:06:03: And this pin, you know, it's also got these lights up at the top here that light up anytime you're doing anything. And there's also a small pin light notification for when there's something waiting for you. So between the weight of the parts and the strength of the magnets, how it all slaps together, like you can tell that a lot of effort was put into the craftsmanship of this product, which I very much appreciate. It's the best part of the pin, by a lot. (mellow instrumental music) Okay, I want you to forget about the smartphone in your pocket for a second. Like just for a minute, just pretend that doesn't exist. Ignore it, right? This little pin can do a lot of stuff, and is very helpful. So again, think of this thing as an AI assistant that's like by your side, all the time with you. So, you can ask it things. It doesn't have a wake word, it only turns the mic on and listens when you touch it. So you can go... (AI Pin beeps) How tall is the Empire State Building? (AI Pin beeps) And then when you let go, it starts sending that query off to the crowd. The- - [AI Pin] The Empire State Building is 1,454 feet tall to the tip. - The Cloud. And then gets you an answer, which is great. And it also is multimodal. So that means it can look at the camera, and see things, and interact with the world around you. So... (AI Pin beeps) Look and tell me what you see. (AI Pin beeps) So it'll scan the room, use the Cloud again. That little noise was it taking a little image, sending AI image to the Cloud, analyzing it, getting it back, then deciding what to tell me. - [AI Pin] You are sitting in front of a camera and a laptop. The camera is on a tripod and pointed at you. The laptop is open, and you are looking at it. There are three pictures of dogs on the wall behind you. There is a window to the left of the camera. There is a boom mic on the table in front of you. There is a red carpet on the floor. - Great. The camera can also take pictures, or up to 15 second videos, which it auto uploads while charging. It can also remember things you tell it to remember. And all these things will show up in the Humane Center. So it's like this online web portal\\n\", \"00:06:05 - 00:08:05: for all things connected to the pin. There's no app, it's just the website. So there, you can see a whole history of who you've called, and texted, and what you've listened to, and what answers it gave to your most recent requests, and all the things you told it to remember. It is pretty well-rounded. I think probably its best tech demo feature though, is the translate back and forth. You got a two finger gesture, you can go... (AI Pin beeps) (Marques speaks in Spanish) (AI Pin beeps) - [AI Pin] Where's the library? - So it auto detects the language, translates it to English, and the person who speaks back can translate back, as long as you hold on the pin and listen to them. Pretty cool. This is all voice stuff though. So if at any point you're in a loud area, or a very private area, and you don't wanna interact out loud with your voice, that's where this projector comes in. So it seems crazy, but you activate it like that, and then you just hold your finger out, your whole palm, and it becomes a projector screen for the laser projector built into the pin. So it takes a little practice, but eventually you get used to holding your hand up in just the right spot, and then the UI gets projected in this green 720p mini screen on your hand. So you basically use your hand, try to be as flat as possible, and then to interact with it, there are some movement gestures. So there's a time of flight sensor that keeps track of movement, and you move your hand around kind of like rolling a marble around in your hand to select something, then pinch to select. You can then make a fist to go back, and then you literally push forward to move deeper into a menu. So this is like a 3D UI you have to learn. This is obviously very brand new for people, but I think to be fair, it is pretty intuitive. I think if you get a quick 60 second lesson, you kind of already have learned all the things you need. When you first connect the booster to the pin, you can unlock it, and unlocking it with my pin, is like this... Move your hand through space to select the numbers thing. It's literally like moving back and forth through a Rolodex of real numbers. So it's one of those like borderline magic things where the first time you see it, you kind of just get it, and it clicks.\\n\", \"00:08:07 - 00:10:07: Even if it is a little fidgety, and a little bit inaccurate and kind of slow. But that gets us into the review. (mellow instrumental music) So, unfortunately... This thing is bad at almost everything it does, basically all the time. Where do I even start? So I guess first of all, okay, it's supposed to just answer questions, right? It can kinda do that sometimes, but one, it's often slow, because most of these requests go to the Cloud and come back, and there's just a long wait. And two, it's often wrong, because AI still can hallucinate, and there are still issues with it just not understanding correctly, or just saying the wrong thing. And that's not even mentioning server timeouts, if you have a poor internet connection, which happens to me all the time in this studio. So when they do most of the demos, like on their websites and in their videos, they'll ask a question, and then they'll let go, and keep talking to fill the silence, so it's not awkward as you wait for an answer, and realize how long it is. But even on this fast studio wifi here... (AI Pin beeps) Who designed the Washington Monument? (AI Pin beeps) - [AI] Finding designer. The Washington Monument was designed by Robert Mills, a prominent 19th century American architect from South Carolina. The construction was eventually completed by- - Okay. So you can just hold your hand up to put your answer on your hand, and interrupt that it's talking so much. But even that was like a pretty good performance for the AI Pin. In ideal, fast wifi conditions. But there are many, many times when I feel like it's way slower, and it seems like it goes to the internet for almost everything. I mean there's a few queries I guess might be local, like... (AI Pin beeps) What time is it? (AI Pin beeps) - [AI Pin] 11:42 AM. - Like that's pretty fast. If I ask the battery life, it can tell me that pretty fast. But it feels like basically everything else is just shoveling it off to the Cloud, not computing on the device, and it takes a while. But it's also just wrong all the time.\\n\", '00:10:09 - 00:12:09: Like, I remember asking it days before the solar eclipse when the next eclipse was, and it said 2044. I asked it, \"What\\'s some good Asian food in the area?\" And over and over again it thought I said, \"What\\'s the best ash?\" For some reason? When is the next Nets game? (AI Pin beeps) - [AI Pin] Finding next Nets game. The next Brooklyn Nets game is on Sunday, April 14th, but no specific opponent or location is provided. - I just Googled it. It says it\\'s the 76ers, so that\\'s kind of weird. (AI Pin beeps) What\\'s the traffic to the Empire State Building from here? (AI Pin beeps) - [AI Pin] Finding direction. Use the voice command feature of AI Pin to ask for traffic information to the Empire State Building, and it will provide you with the details you need. - I did? This stuff happens all the time. But then, speaking of battery life... Really bad. (Marques laughs) And inconsistent, which is annoying. So, it\\'s already kind of bad enough that you have another device, that you also have to charge every single day. But with this, it\\'s actually more than that. You have to constantly babysit the battery, and swap out boosters and charge this thing, and keep it charged multiple times per day. So like I said before, you get two of these things that come with it, and I\\'ve had a pin nuke through the entire booster battery in two hours, while not really doing much of anything. I\\'ve also had it last like four hours while doing a whole bunch of, you know, photos and videos and requests and laser stuff. And it\\'s also just like constantly warm the whole time. Just all the time. Which is a little bit concerning. I\\'ll also say, multiple times in various situations, I\\'ve had it just overheat for seemingly no reason, and tell me to wait a while for it to cool down. I think the heat problem is also amplified because of the gap created by whatever fabric is between the booster and the product,\\n', \"00:12:11 - 00:14:11: that it is actively, inductively charging. You know, it is a lot of very impressive engineering, but wireless charging is notoriously inefficient, and loses energy via heat, and that's what's happening in here all the time. So just the fact that it's warm, just this warm puck on my chest all day, was just enough to never quite forget that I'm wearing it. Well, that and the weight. Look, it's well-made, like I said, it's really impressive hardware, but it's just a little... I mean, you see that little sag? It's just a little too heavy, in the same way that Vision Pro is just a bit too heavy. When you're wearing the thing, you just wanna make it as light as possible. It's why a lot of this stuff is made of plastic. So when you decide to go aluminum instead, yeah, it's just a little too heavy. I feel like Humane in a lot of their videos, they've got all these thick fabrics, and like heavy jackets, so it doesn't really pull down and sag nearly as much. But if you wear some lighter weight materials like I do, especially when it gets warm outside, this is really gonna start to be noticed. And yes, there are some optional accessories that are lighter weight, but you never quite forget about it. This pin cannot set a timer. This pin cannot set an alarm. This notification light they put up at the corner here, it's there and it works, but it is basically out of my peripheral, my field of use, so I almost never see it. And you know, they also chose this corner for the light, which means it's designed to be worn on this half of the body, which is fine, and you get used to it there, but that's also exactly where most seat belts go, in the US anyway. So, not their fault, just another annoying thing about using it. The photos look pretty bad, and the videos look even worse. They're square-ish in aspect ratio, very noisy, and they max out at 15 seconds. The hub that everything syncs with, for me, just randomly stops working, and I have to refresh it to get it to work again. The projector... As impressive as a technical achievement as it is, it's just not very readable. It's not particularly bright outdoors, and it gets dimmer the further from your hand it is\\n\", \"00:14:13 - 00:16:13: because of physics. And unless I knew what those words were saying, I really can't read very much. And... (Marques chuckles) There are no apps. There just are no apps. So when you first sign up with your Humane account, you get to sync with four accounts. There are your Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Tidal. So the first three are basically for your contacts, and then the last one, Tidal is the exclusive music partner. So there is no Uber access, there is no Spotify access, there's no WhatsApp, there's no calendar, no Gmail, none of that stuff. It's just... I can't book a flight, I can't buy something on Amazon. It just will not do any of that stuff that I just do on my phone. (mellow instrumental music) So I know I've said like a bunch of the downsides and the problems this device has, but I really genuinely think the biggest problem this pin is going to have, is that smartphones are kind of OP. The number one thing I've reminded myself from the week of using this pin, trying to get it to do stuff, is that smartphones are not going anywhere anytime soon. And I think a lot of the comments online have already picked up on this, even without testing and using the pin, which is, okay, there seems like a lot of overlap between what this is and what a smartphone can do. But everything that this pin does, a modern smartphone does better and faster, and easier and in higher quality, and just better in every way. Like your smartphone obviously takes better pictures and videos, and you can frame things more easily. Of course, a phone can call and text people more easily. You can use it in more places, loud places, private places, use it with literally any outfit. Also, a phone, like you can quickly Google things, it's faster to message people back. And of course, it can email people, and use all kinds of app experiences.\\n\", '00:16:15 - 00:18:15: Do you know what happens when you try to just send someone a picture from the AI Pin? You already know how to do it on your phone. With the AI Pin, okay, you take the picture, then you either try this with your voice, or you pull up the picture, which is just a green 720p jpeg on your hand. I guess that\\'s a good enough preview, sure. You go to send it, you pick your contact, or type in the whole phone number with the gestures. Eventually, you go to send, and it has its own internet connection, and it sends a link to view the picture in the Humane web portal. Like the difference in how easy, how frictionless that is here versus here, it\\'s not even close. And there are honestly many times where I\\'d be trusting this pin, like I\\'m reviewing it, I\\'m living that life, I\\'m using it, and I\\'d ask it something, and I would wait so long, and my phone would just be sitting right there, where I could just pick it up and Google the answer in the time it takes me to get hopefully the right answer on the pin. It\\'s just... Phones are OP. (AI Pin beeps) Look and tell me what this is. (AI Pin beeps) Or I\\'ll just do this, I guess. Ah... It\\'s a Cybertruck. - [AI Pin] The photo is of a Cybertruck. An electric pickup truck produced by Tesla. - Yup. Also, I gotta say, when I say phones are OP, like screens in your hand. So sick. Just for the last like 10% of any UI, like you can get almost all the way there with just your voice interaction. But let\\'s say you call an Uber, and you say, \"Take me to the studio from an Uber.\" Even if it could do that, which it can\\'t, but let\\'s say it could. And as you\\'re waiting, you\\'re like, \"I\\'m gonna just go grab a snack from this Starbucks on the corner.\" How do you adjust your pickup location with this?\\n', '00:18:17 - 00:20:17: Ugh. Just that friction of, I could just do it in two seconds on my phone. Or buying something online is another one. I\\'ve seen a lot of demos where someone\\'s like, \"Plan me a trip to Europe. Plan me an expedition.\" I don\\'t even wanna buy detergent online on this, because I need to check all the ratings and the titles, and make sure I\\'m ordering the right one. I do not trust that with just my voice. But I think most critically, for the AI assistant part... I actually love the idea of a virtual assistant that you can talk to like a human. Like this is something we\\'ve been chasing for years with Google Assistant, and Siri and Alexa. And now with this new form factor of, you know, a little AI in a box that can be with you everywhere, maybe that can deliver even better on that specific promise, But the thing about a good assistant is it needs to know everything about you. That\\'s even true with a human assistant. Like, it needs to know your schedule, it needs to know where you go every day, it needs to know who you talk to, who your preferences are personally and for products. Like it needs to know everything about you. And your smartphone already knows a lot of things about you. But this is a standalone device that doesn\\'t talk to your phone, and so it doesn\\'t know any of the things about you that your phone knows. So just from that, it\\'s already at such a massive disadvantage for the smartphone for being helpful. I mean, you can do what I did. Fully immerse yourself for several days straight, and tell it to remember everything, and call people, text people from it, but it will always have that gap. And that\\'s not even mentioning this, like I said, it has its own phone number, and so if you text people and call people from this, yeah, it can summarize all of your messages from the day, and all that stuff from these conversations, but it doesn\\'t see any of these conversations. So if you\\'re texting here, this is not the same thread. That gap is always gonna be there. So I guess that begs the question, why didn\\'t they just make this connect to your phone?\\n', '00:20:21 - 00:22:21: Everyone has a phone. That\\'s the question that I think a lot of people are wondering. And I think... This is my theory, but I think Humane wants this thing to eventually be a very powerful standalone device someday. And in order to get it to that future, they can\\'t set the precedent now of connecting it to your phone, \\'cause then that means they have to remove that feature in the future, and they don\\'t wanna do that. So this device as it exists today is hamstrung by its ideal future version of itself. It\\'s like Vision Pro. Like I talked about it in the Vision Pro review. It doesn\\'t actually pair to your iPhone in any way. It\\'s its own standalone computer. And of course, Apple sees down the road, that could just be like a little pair of smart glasses. You don\\'t need an iPhone to use that. But now, today, this thing is a victim of its future ambition. (mellow instrumental music) It was really hard to come up with a title for this video, but I will say, at one point, my working title for this was, \"This product is either the dumbest thing ever, or I\\'m an idiot.\" Because yes, it\\'s really, really, really, really bad now. But every once in a while, and I mean a while, I would use it, and it would do exactly what it\\'s supposed to do quickly, and I\\'d get it. And I\\'d really feel like that\\'s how it\\'s supposed to feel, and I\\'d do another request, and it would remind me of reality. But here\\'s an example, right? I\\'ve said a thousand times, like, my best ideas, golden rule, they always show up when I can\\'t write them down. Like when I\\'m about to fall asleep, or I\\'m in the shower, or driving, right? So I\\'m using the pin, I\\'m driving to the studio and I have an idea. I\\'m not trying to write it down on my phone while driving or pull over, but I had the pin, so I\\'m driving and I just... (AI Pin beeps) \"Remind me of this cool ABC outro idea\\n', '00:22:22 - 00:24:22: for the Humane review.\" (AI Pin beeps) And I just kept driving. And it wrote it down, and it saved it. - [AI Pin] Saving memory. - And when I go check the Humane- - [AI Pin] The outro idea for the Humane review has been saved. - The voice is kind of annoying. But now that\\'s up in the Humane AI Center, so when I arrive at the studio, that thing that I told it to remember, is sitting there waiting for me. That was nice. Or the other thing, the unique first person videos. I could put it in the center of my chest, and take videos. I would never want to distract myself while driving taking a video, but you know, even though the quality\\'s not great, that\\'s the most frictionless version of that, along with smart glasses. That\\'s great. And I think number one, on top of all of this, is if you ask me like, \"Who should buy this device right now?\" I mean, nobody should buy this device right now. But if there\\'s one person who would most consider it, it\\'s the person that wants to spend as little time as possible with a screen in their hands. Like as little time as possible on their phone. And that\\'s me sometimes. I don\\'t wanna doom scroll the second I pull my phone out of my pocket. For that person, if they want that at the expense of everything else, this device represents just a glimmer of hope for that future. Now the problem, of course, is with this device, there\\'s just so much more friction and fumbling and annoyance that comes with it, that you don\\'t wanna do it, even though you would accomplish the goal of less screen time and living in the moment. But yeah, that\\'s the issue with it. I literally had a moment, like we did a shoot in Ohio the other day, which was like a travel day. And I woke up in the morning and I thought like, \"I don\\'t want to deal with this pin today.\" Like I have driving, so the seat belt\\'s gonna be annoying, and then we\\'re gonna go to the airport, and then probably gotta take it off through the metal detector and then put it on again, which means I have to log in with the pin again and... Just all this, and I just was like, \"I don\\'t wanna have to charge this seven times. Like , I don\\'t wanna wear it today.\" So I skipped it. And you should probably skip this product too. And never buy a product based on the future promise of updates to it.\\n', \"00:24:23 - 00:26:23: Obviously, this is a product that has a long way to go, and there's a team behind it. And look, I gotta say, as a brand new product, and a team trying to make something new... That, I respect. I respect the attempt. Because we don't get a lot of totally new stuff. But yeah, this has a long way to go. They do have a roadmap, actually. I'll say. They've shared it. There's some decent stuff on there, including number sharing, but that also has no date and no other information. So I'll just say, good luck. Godspeed. Thanks for watching. Catch you in the next one. Peace. (calming steel drum music fades)\\n\"]\n",

00:17:32: thought no I don't want to die that that \", '00:17:30 - 00:17:34: way so I turned back and I tried to ', '00:17:32 - 00:17:35: figure out if there was some other way I ', '00:17:34 - 00:17:37: could ', '00:17:35 - 00:17:40: die that would be more ', \"00:17:37 - 00:17:43: pleasant or could avoid death is there's \", '00:17:40 - 00:17:45: some way I could avoid death no matter ', '00:17:43 - 00:17:48: how hard I thought about it there was no ', '00:17:45 - 00:17:50: way I could avoid death I mean it might ', '00:17:48 - 00:17:54: take 40 years but I was still going to ', \"00:17:50 - 00:17:57: die you understand I mean I I'm taking \", '00:17:54 - 00:17:58: you now into my LSD world all right ', '00:17:57 - 00:18:00: there was no way that I could could ', '00:17:58 - 00:18:02: avoid ', '00:18:00 - 00:18:05: death and I realized that as long as I ', '00:18:02 - 00:18:07: thought I was anybody I was going to ', '00:18:05 - 00:18:09: die and what was going to die was who I ', '00:18:07 - 00:18:11: thought I ', '00:18:09 - 00:18:13: was and if ', '00:18:11 - 00:18:15: I each time I had a new thought of who I ', '00:18:13 - 00:18:16: was that one was going to die too one ', '00:18:15 - 00:18:19: way or ', '00:18:16 - 00:18:22: another and finally since I could find ', '00:18:19 - 00:18:24: no way out there was a no exit situation ', '00:18:22 - 00:18:27: there was no way not to ', '00:18:24 - 00:18:29: die I thought well why wait and I turned ', '00:18:27 - 00:18:30: to this big picture of maharaji said I ', '00:18:29 - 00:18:33: said ', '00:18:30 - 00:18:35: maharaji would you please let me die ', \"00:18:33 - 00:18:38: I've had \", '00:18:35 - 00:18:40: enough and I laid down and I experienced ', '00:18:38 - 00:18:43: my ', '00:18:40 - 00:18:43: thoughts they ', '00:18:44 - 00:18:49: went until pretty soon I saw each ', '00:18:46 - 00:18:53: thought arising existing and passing ', '00:18:49 - 00:18:55: away tiny space next thought arising and ', '00:18:53 - 00:18:58: as long as I was in a thought I was ', '00:18:55 - 00:18:59: living and I was somebody and I was ', '00:18:58 - 00:19:02: going to die ', '00:18:59 - 00:19:05: and then the spaces between the thoughts ', '00:19:02 - 00:19:10: became more pronounced and finally I was ', '00:19:05 - 00:19:13: sitting in a thought facing the space ', '00:19:10 - 00:19:17: and I dove into the space which was the ', '00:19:13 - 00:19:17: space between two ', '00:19:18 - 00:19:24: thoughts now the next thing that ', '00:19:22 - 00:19:27: I ', '00:19:24 - 00:19:30: experienced was the ', '00:19:27 - 00:19:31: thought well now you can be anything you ', '00:19:30 - 00:19:35: want to ', '00:19:31 - 00:19:38: be and the thought after that was ', '00:19:35 - 00:19:41: uhoh you came ', '00:19:38 - 00:19:44: back do you hear that I grabbed do you ', '00:19:41 - 00:19:46: hear the way that works I mean it was ', '00:19:44 - 00:19:47: Bitter Sweet I could be anything I ', '00:19:46 - 00:19:50: wanted to be but I still was going to be ', '00:19:47 - 00:19:52: something because even though I was free ', '00:19:50 - 00:19:55: to choose now because I saw that I ', \"00:19:52 - 00:19:57: wasn't who I thought I was still any \", '00:19:55 - 00:19:59: thought I grabbed onto and I had grabbed ', '00:19:57 - 00:20:01: because there I was back again ', \"00:19:59 - 00:20:03: now how long that space lasted I don't \", '00:20:01 - 00:20:06: know it might have lasted a millionth of ', '00:20:03 - 00:20:09: a second it might have lasted an hour I ', '00:20:06 - 00:20:11: have no way of knowing that I it was ', '00:20:09 - 00:20:13: within that range I assume because of ', '00:20:11 - 00:20:15: the way that night and day and all that ', '00:20:13 - 00:20:18: and the rest of the session was all very ', '00:20:15 - 00:20:21: interesting and pleasant well in telling ', '00:20:18 - 00:20:25: manindra about this ', '00:20:21 - 00:20:27: experience he said to me well that was ', '00:20:25 -

      "Captions representation: '00:00:00 - 00:02:00: Another year, another gift guide—without\\xa0\\nthe expensive, sponsored crap you\\'ll see\\xa0\\xa0 everywhere else. Gather round for legitimately\\xa0\\ncool gadgets you probably haven\\'t heard of—some\\xa0\\xa0 of my favorites, and some of yours too. Oh, and\\xa0\\nsave for one product, none of these are sponsored. I hate the multi-monitor lifestyle, but I do\\xa0\\nfind myself wanting to place a static window\\xa0\\xa0 on a smaller display—with the hilariously named\\xa0\\nKwumsy K3, I can! This thing is an RGB mechanical\\xa0\\xa0 keyboard, laptop I/O hub, SSD enclosure, and\\xa0\\n13\" touchscreen—all in one. Supply it power,\\xa0\\xa0 data, and video from your laptop or desktop\\xa0\\nand you\\'re off to the races. You\\'ve got access\\xa0\\xa0 to the fairly bandwith-limited but still capable\\xa0\\n5Gbps throughput for other USB devices, SD cards,\\xa0\\xa0 and even an M.2-sized SSD. The keyboard is nice\\xa0\\nwith surprisingly fancy double-shot PBT caps and\\xa0\\xa0 less fancy generic yellow MX-style switches.\\xa0\\nThat said, the switches are solderless so you\\xa0\\xa0 can use the included tool to pop them right out\\xa0\\nand substitute your preferred combo. Neato. The\\xa0\\xa0 screen is 1920x720 and has a luminance of 300\\xa0\\nnits. It’s not fantastic—viewing angles are less\\xa0\\xa0 than superb—but when angled right, looks better\\xa0\\nthan the specs may suggest and having the ability\\xa0\\xa0 to use it at any angle makes it the perfect\\xa0\\n10-point multitouch sketch pad for Windows,\\xa0\\xa0 a suitable social feed for macOS, and\\xa0\\neven a cyberdeck console for Raspberry Pi. All of us carry a flashlight around with us\\xa0\\nevery day, but a smartphone is a pretty lousy\\xa0\\xa0 one—this is the Aurora A8. It\\'s a teeny-tiny\\xa0\\nLED flashlight that brightens to an insane 650\\xa0\\xa0 lumens. Don\\'t know how bright that\\xa0\\nis? Well, here\\'s an iPhone 15 Pro,\\xa0\\xa0\\n00:02:01 - 00:04:01: and here\\'s this little flashlight. Yeah, not only\\xa0\\ndoes the single button toggle through brightness\\xa0\\xa0 settings, but it also has a UV light onboard\\xa0\\nto inspect currency and sketchy hotel rooms,\\xa0\\xa0 it has a red light great for use when dark\\xa0\\nwithout losing night vision, it can flash\\xa0\\xa0 if you have it attached to a backpack to alert\\xa0\\ncars of your presence, and it has a flood light\\xa0\\xa0 to illuminate an area like a tent. It runs for\\xa0\\nhours on its internal battery, charges via USB-C,\\xa0\\xa0 and comes with a clip, keyring, and magnetic base\\xa0\\nto attach to basically anything. It\\'s amazing. If you\\'re a 90s kid that grew up on Bop-It\\xa0\\nlike I did, you\\'ll love Flipslide. This\\xa0\\xa0 cheap puzzle game has you flip and slide\\xa0\\ncolored tiles to match those displayed\\xa0\\xa0 on-screen. What sounds simple gets really\\xa0\\nintense with a variety of game modes from a\\xa0\\xa0 simon-says-style mode to level mode which gives\\xa0\\nyou increasingly less time as you progress and\\xa0\\xa0 even multiplayer mode that had my wife and I\\xa0\\nlaughing hysterically. It\\'s perfect to play\\xa0\\xa0 alone or with friends and priced the way it\\xa0\\nis, it\\'s impossible to say no to. Get it. You should also get the Dyad Pro and S8 Pro\\xa0\\nUltra from today\\'s sponsor, Roborock. You\\xa0\\xa0 may recall Roborock sponsored last year\\'s gift\\xa0\\nguide—I personally sought them out to sponsor\\xa0\\xa0 again this year because I love their products so\\xa0\\nmuch. The Dyad Pro is a cordless wet-dry vacuum\\xa0\\xa0 that handles basically anything you can throw at\\xa0\\nit. Multiple brush rollers underneath the device\\xa0\\xa0 wet and scrub your floor free of sticky, stainy\\xa0\\ngrime within 1mm of walls and the powerful 17,000\\xa0\\xa0 pascal motor sucks up all of the waste—both wet\\xa0\\nand dry. The onboard DirTech smart sensor analyzes\\xa0\\xa0 grime concentration on the rollers and adjusts\\xa0\\nwater flow and suction accordingly to handle all\\xa0\\xa0 tasks. Most wet-dry vacs are more hassle than\\xa0\\nthey\\'re worth, but not the Dyad Pro because\\xa0\\xa0\\n00:04:06 - 00:06:06: upon returning it to its dock it self-cleans and\\xa0\\nhot-air dries the entire system making it ready\\xa0\\xa0 day after day, week after week. There\\'s even\\xa0\\nan onboard cleaning concentrate dispenser for\\xa0\\xa0 scrubbing with surfactants, so you really only\\xa0\\nhave to add clean water—and empty the dirty\\xa0\\xa0 tank—when you feel like it. And the only thing\\xa0\\nbetter than a gadget that lessens work is one\\xa0\\xa0 that removes it entirely—that\\'s where the Roborock\\xa0\\nS8 Pro Ultra comes in. This vacuum is exceptional\\xa0\\xa0 at its primary job—picking up debris—thanks to\\xa0\\nits dual-roller brush design and class-leading\\xa0\\xa0 6,000 pascal suction. This thing will get hair,\\xa0\\ncrumbs, food, and more—from both hardwood and\\xa0\\xa0 carpet. When the latter is detected, suction is\\xa0\\nboosted and the mop is raised so as to not touch\\xa0\\xa0 rug and carpet fibers. Oh yeah, this thing mops\\xa0\\ntoo with its VibraRise system that scrubs the\\xa0\\xa0 floor pretty aggressively removing a surprising\\xa0\\namount of floor grime. When its finished its task,\\xa0\\xa0 the bot returns to its all-in-one dock that\\xa0\\nempties the dust bin, washes the mop pad,\\xa0\\xa0 hot-air dries said pad and station to avoid\\xa0\\nmildew, refills the on-board water tank, and\\xa0\\xa0 charges the bot for its next journey. It\\'s a great\\xa0\\nvacuum and mop, but the reason I\\'ve continued to\\xa0\\xa0 use Roborock vacuums exclusively on the main floor\\xa0\\nof my home the past 4 years is the excellent,\\xa0\\xa0 class-leading app and navigation system. Not only\\xa0\\nis it easy to issue commands and set schedules,\\xa0\\xa0 but most importantly, my S8 Pro Ultra has\\xa0\\nvacuumed for nearly 200 hours since I got\\xa0\\xa0 it earlier this year, and in the past month, it\\xa0\\nhasn\\'t failed a route even once. It almost never\\xa0\\xa0 gets stuck avoiding any obstacles placed before\\xa0\\nit, requires essentially zero maintenance, and\\xa0\\xa0 keeps my floor clean for weeks before I have to\\xa0\\nthink about lifting a finger. It\\'s seriously one\\xa0\\xa0 of the best tech gadgets I\\'ve ever owned—period. I\\xa0\\nlove it and know you will too—be sure to check out\\xa0\\xa0\\n00:06:06 - 00:08:06: the S8 Pro Ultra and Dyad Pro while their Black\\xa0\\nFriday deals are ongoing using the links below. ISDT is a brand known to anyone that pilots\\xa0\\ndrones or RC cars as they make some of the\\xa0\\xa0 best LiPo battery chargers on the market. What I\\xa0\\ndidn\\'t know until recently is that they also make\\xa0\\xa0 an absolute chungus 200W USB charger. This thing\\xa0\\nhas 3 type-C PD ports that can deliver 65/65/and\\xa0\\xa0 a highly unusual, but amazing 140W—maxing out even\\xa0\\nthe 16\" M3 Max MacBook Pro under full load while\\xa0\\xa0 fast charging. Furthermore, the lone USB-A port\\xa0\\nsupports up to 24W with support for all protocols\\xa0\\xa0 like Qualcomm QuickCharge. A handsome LCD display\\xa0\\nreads out the wattage being pushed to each device\\xa0\\xa0 including to the wireless charging pad which uses\\xa0\\nan MFi-certified MagSafe puck that pushes the full\\xa0\\xa0 15W of wireless power the iPhone is capable\\xa0\\nof. Given that making chargers is literally\\xa0\\xa0 ISDT\\'s bread-and-butter, I was unsurprised\\xa0\\nbut pleased to see quiet active cooling and\\xa0\\xa0 overheat protection triggers. There’s even an\\xa0\\napp—if you want such a thing—and it comes with\\xa0\\xa0 2 high-quality 240W-capable Type-C cables.\\xa0\\nFor the price they’re asking, it’s a steal. Wired headphones are back in amongst the\\xa0\\nyouth, I hear, and the Questyle M15 is\\xa0\\xa0 a must-have HiFi accessory for any wired\\xa0\\nheadphones-listener. It\\'s a USB-C powered\\xa0\\xa0 DAC and headphone amp in an insanely tiny\\xa0\\npackage. In years past, this small size\\xa0\\xa0 would suggest lousy amplification capabilities,\\xa0\\nbut no... this thing is nuts: it can power my\\xa0\\xa0 super inefficient Audeze LCD-3 just as well as\\xa0\\nlarger headphone amps I\\'ve seen in the sub-$300\\xa0\\xa0 price range. Sound quality is fantastic,\\xa0\\nthere\\'s insanely low noise floor to boot,\\xa0\\xa0 it works with iOS and macOS, supports lossless\\xa0\\naudio of course, and is just... awesomely tiny.\\n00:08:10 - 00:10:10: Moving to tiny things my wife loves... this micro\\xa0\\nratchet wrench—I love it too! This thing is just\\xa0\\xa0 2\" long—like my pinkie. Any 1/4\" bit slips inside\\xa0\\nand can be ratcheted both left and right. It\\'s so\\xa0\\xa0 small, it can basically be used as a screwdriver\\xa0\\nand in instances where you just don\\'t have\\xa0\\xa0 clearance, well, stick the 1/4 bit in the opposite\\xa0\\nend and now you\\'ve got a stubby screwdriver. I\\'ve\\xa0\\xa0 been keeping this with some bits in an Altoids\\xa0\\ntin in my backpack and it\\'s fabulously handy. I don\\'t like things on my phone so when Moft\\'s\\xa0\\ntripod stand was suggested to me by Joel,\\xa0\\xa0 I knew I\\'d hate it. Well folks, I knew wrong—this\\xa0\\nthing is sweet. It snaps onto the back of your\\xa0\\xa0 phone and unfolds in a cascading origami\\xa0\\nstructure. You can set it up in a variety of\\xa0\\xa0 different ways making it useful for vlogging,\\xa0\\nfor video calls when using Continuity Camera,\\xa0\\xa0 when watching movies, as a tripod for group\\xa0\\nphotos and more. It\\'s light, way thinner than\\xa0\\xa0 you\\'d think given its capabilities, and I love\\xa0\\nit—even if the price is a bit tough to swallow. Last year I mentioned Omnifixo, the perfect\\xa0\\nhelping-hands companion for soldering. Many\\xa0\\xa0 asked what iron I\\'d recommend for those new\\xa0\\nto soldering but I didn\\'t have an answer—at\\xa0\\xa0 least not until I ordered a Pinecil earlier this\\xa0\\nyear. This $26 soldering iron is incredible and\\xa0\\xa0 punches way above its price tag. For starters,\\xa0\\nits entirely open-source and runs a risc-five\\xa0\\xa0 CPU. Why on earth would you need this? Well, it\\xa0\\ngives you precise temperature control on the OLED\\xa0\\xa0 display between 100 and 450 degrees celsius, it\\xa0\\ncan reach said temperature in just 6 seconds,\\xa0\\xa0 and automatically enters standby as soon as the\\xa0\\non-board accelerometer stops detecting motion. You\\xa0\\xa0\\n00:10:17 - 00:12:17: can use Pinecil\\'s shorty-tips or any standardized\\xa0\\nTS-100 tip to get more precision—dependent on your\\xa0\\xa0 soldering application, and while you\\'ve seen\\xa0\\nme using it thus far with a DC barrel jack,\\xa0\\xa0 the Pinecil even supports USB-C PD! This\\xa0\\nthing is amazing and blows the door off of\\xa0\\xa0 any other sub-$75 soldering iron. For literally\\xa0\\n26 bucks. Buying one is basically legal theft. Ya know, not every gift has to be new and if\\xa0\\nyou\\'re running a Mac without a versioned or\\xa0\\xa0 restorable backup, shame on you—especially since\\xa0\\nyou can get an old Apple Time Capsule on eBay for\\xa0\\xa0 less than $30. I got mine for $20 with a dead\\xa0\\nhard drive, and I was able to easily swap out\\xa0\\xa0 the cheapo stock drive with a 2TB SATA SSD I\\xa0\\nbought from Amazon for $70. It\\'s amazing how\\xa0\\xa0 cheap SSDs have become. Now, the Time Capsule when\\xa0\\nreleased acted as a router and WiFi access point\\xa0\\xa0 but I don\\'t want either of those enabled because\\xa0\\nthis thing is old... So, to make this a NAS, we\\'re\\xa0\\xa0 going to use an Ethernet cable from our router or\\xa0\\nswitch and plug it into the WAN port on the Time\\xa0\\xa0 Capsule. Then, we open AirPort Utility on our Mac\\xa0\\nor iPhone, select our Time Capsule, go to Wireless\\xa0\\xa0 and turn it off. Then, we go into the network tab\\xa0\\nand set it to off or bridge mode so it doesn\\'t try\\xa0\\xa0 to create its own subnet and give us double NAT\\xa0\\nissues. We can still use the Time Capsule as a\\xa0\\xa0 switch for other devices, but more importantly,\\xa0\\nwe can now setup Time Machine and have all Macs\\xa0\\xa0 on our network create versioned backups. We\\xa0\\ncan even use it as a shared file or media\\xa0\\xa0 server. I\\'m taking this 2TB all-flash NAS home—I\\xa0\\nmean, for less than $100, how could I say no?\\n00:12:19 - 00:14:19: Meghan is better with a kitchen knife than I am so\\xa0\\nshe naturally hates single-use kitchen gadgets and\\xa0\\xa0 when she saw I got the Dreamfarm Garject, she\\xa0\\nrolled her eyes; but then, I used it, and she\\xa0\\xa0 said \"okay, that\\'s actually really sick.\" Take a\\xa0\\ngarlic clove, or multiple—papery peels and all—and\\xa0\\xa0 load it into the Garject. Then, close the handle\\xa0\\nand see the garlic pressed through the holes with\\xa0\\xa0 ease to a minced consistency—just like a regular\\xa0\\ngarlic press. But now watch... upon opening the\\xa0\\xa0 handles back up, the built-in scraper flicks\\xa0\\nall of the gooey garlic into your dish. Then,\\xa0\\xa0 hitting the eject button removes the paper from\\xa0\\nthe press and its ready for the dishwasher. It\\'s\\xa0\\xa0 a brilliantly quick way to get through the\\xa0\\nstickiest, stinkiest part of your meal prep. Trust in the Germans to over-engineer the simplest\\xa0\\nhand-tool ever made—the screwdriver—with the WERA\\xa0\\xa0 Kraftform Turbo. In its standard state, it\\'s\\xa0\\njust a screwdriver with a really sloppy shaft,\\xa0\\xa0 but press the button at the back of the\\xa0\\nscrewdriver, and you\\'ll enable turbo mode—a\\xa0\\xa0 purely mechanical gear train that turns\\xa0\\none rotation of the hand into 4 rotations\\xa0\\xa0 of the shank. You can do this two handed\\xa0\\nor single-handed, but the end result is a\\xa0\\xa0 lot less twisting while getting screws in and\\xa0\\nout a lot faster. Personally, I find this more\\xa0\\xa0 effective than a ratcheting driver when I\\'ve\\xa0\\ngot a lot of screws to burn through, though it\\xa0\\xa0 doesn\\'t have a ton of torque, so for tightening\\xa0\\nor loosening past a few pound feet, you\\'ll want\\xa0\\xa0 to push the button to re-enable standard driver\\xa0\\nmode. It\\'s absurdly unnecessary and I love it. I travel light and while I love the tiny 30W\\xa0\\nbricks that exist nowadays, they scratch the heck\\xa0\\xa0 out of everything in my bag, so I\\'ve defaulted to\\xa0\\nNomad\\'s Slim lineup of gallium nitride chargers.\\xa0\\xa0\\n00:14:21 - 00:16:21: They\\'ve got a single-port 35W and two-port\\xa0\\n65W model—both tiny and lightweight, but\\xa0\\xa0 more importantly, flat. Not only does this help\\xa0\\navoid the scratchy-scratchy, but it also pushes\\xa0\\xa0 the weight of the charger inwards so it doesn\\'t\\xa0\\ndroop or fall out from loose, worn hotel outlets. I\\'ve owned my Playdate for a year-and-a-half,\\xa0\\nand they\\'re now just finally finishing their\\xa0\\xa0 pre-order shipments to the point where you can buy\\xa0\\none and actually get it soon. It\\'s a cute, little,\\xa0\\xa0 yellow game console with a one-bit transflective\\xa0\\nLCD—there\\'s no backlight here—so it\\'s best viewed\\xa0\\xa0 in the sun. I\\'ve never owned a literal one-bit\\xa0\\nscreen before but I love it. Seeing the art style\\xa0\\xa0 choices required to create the perception\\xa0\\nof \"white and black\" is super beautiful. In\\xa0\\xa0 addition to USB-C, on-board WiFi, a rather decent\\xa0\\nspeaker, and face buttons, it has a crank—which\\xa0\\xa0 is silly but a fun mechanic in several of games\\xa0\\nthat use it. So here\\'s the thing... Playdate is\\xa0\\xa0 very expensive at $199. Now, much of that cost\\xa0\\ngoes towards software because it does include 24\\xa0\\xa0 games that are unlocked once per week, every week,\\xa0\\nfor 12 weeks; and, nearly all of the games are\\xa0\\xa0 built by famous devs. Many of them are amazing, a\\xa0\\nfew are just fine, some are long and several are\\xa0\\xa0 short. Even taking the included games library into\\xa0\\naccount, $200 is still nuts. My brain and wallet\\xa0\\xa0 commands me to hate thing, but I just can\\'t. It\\'s\\xa0\\nabsolutely whimsical, the games are innovative,\\xa0\\xa0 it\\'s superb for quick 3-minute game sessions, and\\xa0\\nit\\'s so tiny you can take it with you everywhere.\\xa0\\xa0\\n00:16:25 - 00:18:25: The community behind it is passionate and there\\'s\\xa0\\nan enormous catalog of really great additional\\xa0\\xa0 games that have been released for cheap and even\\xa0\\noftentimes free—through both the Playdate Catalog\\xa0\\xa0 store and Itch.io. It\\'s the antithesis of cutting\\xa0\\nedge to the point of being obnoxiously hipster,\\xa0\\xa0 but I don\\'t care—it\\'s so much fun, I adore it,\\xa0\\nand have for the nearly 2 years I\\'ve owned it. I love my Fluke 115 multimeter—it has saved\\xa0\\nme from getting electrocuted a bunch of times.\\xa0\\xa0 But for $225, it doesn\\'t really DO that much. The\\xa0\\nAustralian-developed Pokit Pro on the other hand,\\xa0\\xa0 very much does. It\\'s a tiny little multimeter\\xa0\\npen that uses a smartphone as a display screen.\\xa0\\xa0 If this sounds dumb to you, I agree, but here\\'s\\xa0\\nthe thing... it\\'s not just a multimeter. It\\'s\\xa0\\xa0 also an oscilloscope and data logger. And this\\xa0\\nisn\\'t just a dumb-bum oscilloscope either—you\\xa0\\xa0 can use functions to check frequency, RMS,\\xa0\\nperiod, average, duty, and more. You can\\xa0\\xa0 even establish triggers to choose when and how a\\xa0\\nsignal is captured. With wireless multi-channel\\xa0\\xa0 support through a single app, you\\'re off to\\xa0\\nthe races for multiple-probe support and the\\xa0\\xa0 built-in data logger is also sweet... you can take\\xa0\\nelectrical or even temperature measurements using\\xa0\\xa0 the onboard thermistor or and external NTC probe\\xa0\\nover an extended period of time—up to 6 months—all\\xa0\\xa0 logged on-device and synced to the mobile app at\\xa0\\na later date. You can now even setup range testing\\xa0\\xa0 wherein you can establish measurement thresholds\\xa0\\nto quickly and easily identify passing spec by LED\\xa0\\xa0 color and buzzer without needing to use a phone\\xa0\\nor display at all. If Pokit Pro is a bit pricey\\xa0\\xa0 for you, most of the features are available on the\\xa0\\neven smaller Pokit Meter that you can get for less\\xa0\\xa0 than $100. I don\\'t think anything in this\\xa0\\nprice comes even close to feature-set or\\xa0\\xa0\\n00:18:28 - 00:20:28: size—and it more than makes up for having\\xa0\\nto awkwardly use a phone to see the data. If your significant other told you they bought\\xa0\\na 9\" Unicorn Magnum Plus, what would you believe\\xa0\\xa0 that to be? If you guessed a pepper mill, wow,\\xa0\\nyou\\'re weird—but also, correct. The market is\\xa0\\xa0 being flooded with nonsense $150+ salt and pepper\\xa0\\nmills made from machined aluminum and lemme tell\\xa0\\xa0 you what: they suck compared to this ugly, plastic\\xa0\\nUSA-made treasure. Compare the Magnum to my cheap\\xa0\\xa0 but dependable OXO radial grinder or bougie\\xa0\\nCole and Mason mill, and it disgraces their very\\xa0\\xa0 existence. The Magnum can crack out a teaspoon\\xa0\\nof pepper with just 6 rotations. It makes so much\\xa0\\xa0 pepper that it almost makes too much pepper. There\\xa0\\nisn\\'t much in the way of fine granular control,\\xa0\\xa0 but it doesn\\'t matter because you can\\'t\\xa0\\nexpect to tame 9\" hog. The Magnum sprays\\xa0\\xa0 its love everywhere and you\\'d be lucky to own\\xa0\\none. Seriously... they\\'re almost always sold out. When I first saw the Kinipex Cobra xtra-small\\xa0\\npliers, I thought they were joke pliers. Like...\\xa0\\xa0 seriously... these are tiny. What on earth could\\xa0\\nthey be useful for? Dude... so many things.\\xa0\\xa0 Despite being a mere 4\", there are 11 adjustment\\xa0\\npositions that open past 1 and 1/8ths inch—or...\\xa0\\xa0 28mm if you\\'re scared of fractions and freedom.\\xa0\\nNow, the shorter handles don\\'t give you insane\\xa0\\xa0 leverage, but you get more than you need for most\\xa0\\napplications and the crazy number of adjustment\\xa0\\xa0 positions in addition to the long jaw-tip length\\xa0\\nlets them often pull double-duty as an adjustable\\xa0\\xa0 wrench. While you lack cutters, the pipe grips are\\xa0\\nsharp as all get out and bite into anything. These\\xa0\\xa0 are German—and we already established they don\\'t\\xa0\\nmess around. I think the perfect gift is something\\xa0\\xa0\\n00:20:29 - 00:22:29: that\\'s just pricey enough you probably wouldn\\'t\\xa0\\nbuy it on your own volition but something you\\'d\\xa0\\xa0 use all the time if received—at $30, these\\xa0\\nweirdo little pliers are that.

      "Captions after['00:00:00 - 00:02:00: Another year, another gift guide—without the expensive, sponsored crap you\\'ll see everywhere else. Gather round for legitimately cool gadgets you probably haven\\'t heard of—some of my favorites, and some of yours too. Oh, and save for one product, none of these are sponsored. I hate the multi-monitor lifestyle, but I do find myself wanting to place a static window on a smaller display—with the hilariously named Kwumsy K3, I can! This thing is an RGB mechanical keyboard, laptop I/O hub, SSD enclosure, and 13\" touchscreen—all in one. Supply it power, data, and video from your laptop or desktop and you\\'re off to the races. You\\'ve got access to the fairly bandwith-limited but still capable 5Gbps throughput for other USB devices, SD cards, and even an M.2-sized SSD. The keyboard is nice with surprisingly fancy double-shot PBT caps and less fancy generic yellow MX-style switches. That said, the switches are solderless so you can use the included tool to pop them right out and substitute your preferred combo. Neato. The screen is 1920x720 and has a luminance of 300 nits. It’s not fantastic—viewing angles are less than superb—but when angled right, looks better than the specs may suggest and having the ability to use it at any angle makes it the perfect 10-point multitouch sketch pad for Windows, a suitable social feed for macOS, and even a cyberdeck console for Raspberry Pi. All of us carry a flashlight around with us every day, but a smartphone is a pretty lousy one—this is the Aurora A8. It\\'s a teeny-tiny LED flashlight that brightens to an insane 650 lumens. Don\\'t know how bright that is? Well, here\\'s an iPhone 15 Pro,\\n', \"00:02:01 - 00:04:01: and here's this little flashlight. Yeah, not only does the single button toggle through brightness settings, but it also has a UV light onboard to inspect currency and sketchy hotel rooms, it has a red light great for use when dark without losing night vision, it can flash if you have it attached to a backpack to alert cars of your presence, and it has a flood light to illuminate an area like a tent. It runs for hours on its internal battery, charges via USB-C, and comes with a clip, keyring, and magnetic base to attach to basically anything. It's amazing. If you're a 90s kid that grew up on Bop-It like I did, you'll love Flipslide. This cheap puzzle game has you flip and slide colored tiles to match those displayed on-screen. What sounds simple gets really intense with a variety of game modes from a simon-says-style mode to level mode which gives you increasingly less time as you progress and even multiplayer mode that had my wife and I laughing hysterically. It's perfect to play alone or with friends and priced the way it is, it's impossible to say no to. Get it. You should also get the Dyad Pro and S8 Pro Ultra from today's sponsor, Roborock. You may recall Roborock sponsored last year's gift guide—I personally sought them out to sponsor again this year because I love their products so much. The Dyad Pro is a cordless wet-dry vacuum that handles basically anything you can throw at it. Multiple brush rollers underneath the device wet and scrub your floor free of sticky, stainy grime within 1mm of walls and the powerful 17,000 pascal motor sucks up all of the waste—both wet and dry. The onboard DirTech smart sensor analyzes grime concentration on the rollers and adjusts water flow and suction accordingly to handle all tasks. Most wet-dry vacs are more hassle than they're worth, but not the Dyad Pro because\\n\", \"00:04:06 - 00:06:06: upon returning it to its dock it self-cleans and hot-air dries the entire system making it ready day after day, week after week. There's even an onboard cleaning concentrate dispenser for scrubbing with surfactants, so you really only have to add clean water—and empty the dirty tank—when you feel like it. And the only thing better than a gadget that lessens work is one that removes it entirely—that's where the Roborock S8 Pro Ultra comes in. This vacuum is exceptional at its primary job—picking up debris—thanks to its dual-roller brush design and class-leading 6,000 pascal suction. This thing will get hair, crumbs, food, and more—from both hardwood and carpet. When the latter is detected, suction is boosted and the mop is raised so as to not touch rug and carpet fibers. Oh yeah, this thing mops too with its VibraRise system that scrubs the floor pretty aggressively removing a surprising amount of floor grime. When its finished its task, the bot returns to its all-in-one dock that empties the dust bin, washes the mop pad, hot-air dries said pad and station to avoid mildew, refills the on-board water tank, and charges the bot for its next journey. It's a great vacuum and mop, but the reason I've continued to use Roborock vacuums exclusively on the main floor of my home the past 4 years is the excellent, class-leading app and navigation system. Not only is it easy to issue commands and set schedules, but most importantly, my S8 Pro Ultra has vacuumed for nearly 200 hours since I got it earlier this year, and in the past month, it hasn't failed a route even once. It almost never gets stuck avoiding any obstacles placed before it, requires essentially zero maintenance, and keeps my floor clean for weeks before I have to think about lifting a finger. It's seriously one of the best tech gadgets I've ever owned—period. I love it and know you will too—be sure to check out\\n\", '00:06:06 - 00:08:06: the S8 Pro Ultra and Dyad Pro while their Black Friday deals are ongoing using the links below. ISDT is a brand known to anyone that pilots drones or RC cars as they make some of the best LiPo battery chargers on the market. What I didn\\'t know until recently is that they also make an absolute chungus 200W USB charger. This thing has 3 type-C PD ports that can deliver 65/65/and a highly unusual, but amazing 140W—maxing out even the 16\" M3 Max MacBook Pro under full load while fast charging. Furthermore, the lone USB-A port supports up to 24W with support for all protocols like Qualcomm QuickCharge. A handsome LCD display reads out the wattage being pushed to each device including to the wireless charging pad which uses an MFi-certified MagSafe puck that pushes the full 15W of wireless power the iPhone is capable of. Given that making chargers is literally ISDT\\'s bread-and-butter, I was unsurprised but pleased to see quiet active cooling and overheat protection triggers. There’s even an app—if you want such a thing—and it comes with 2 high-quality 240W-capable Type-C cables. For the price they’re asking, it’s a steal. Wired headphones are back in amongst the youth, I hear, and the Questyle M15 is a must-have HiFi accessory for any wired headphones-listener. It\\'s a USB-C powered DAC and headphone amp in an insanely tiny package. In years past, this small size would suggest lousy amplification capabilities, but no... this thing is nuts: it can power my super inefficient Audeze LCD-3 just as well as larger headphone amps I\\'ve seen in the sub-$300 price range. Sound quality is fantastic, there\\'s insanely low noise floor to boot, it works with iOS and macOS, supports lossless audio of course, and is just... awesomely tiny.\\n', '00:08:10 - 00:10:10: Moving to tiny things my wife loves... this micro ratchet wrench—I love it too! This thing is just 2\" long—like my pinkie. Any 1/4\" bit slips inside and can be ratcheted both left and right. It\\'s so small, it can basically be used as a screwdriver and in instances where you just don\\'t have clearance, well, stick the 1/4 bit in the opposite end and now you\\'ve got a stubby screwdriver. I\\'ve been keeping this with some bits in an Altoids tin in my backpack and it\\'s fabulously handy. I don\\'t like things on my phone so when Moft\\'s tripod stand was suggested to me by Joel, I knew I\\'d hate it. Well folks, I knew wrong—this thing is sweet. It snaps onto the back of your phone and unfolds in a cascading origami structure. You can set it up in a variety of different ways making it useful for vlogging, for video calls when using Continuity Camera, when watching movies, as a tripod for group photos and more. It\\'s light, way thinner than you\\'d think given its capabilities, and I love it—even if the price is a bit tough to swallow. Last year I mentioned Omnifixo, the perfect helping-hands companion for soldering. Many asked what iron I\\'d recommend for those new to soldering but I didn\\'t have an answer—at least not until I ordered a Pinecil earlier this year. This $26 soldering iron is incredible and punches way above its price tag. For starters, its entirely open-source and runs a risc-five CPU. Why on earth would you need this? Well, it gives you precise temperature control on the OLED display between 100 and 450 degrees celsius, it can reach said temperature in just 6 seconds, and automatically enters standby as soon as the on-board accelerometer stops detecting motion. You\\n', \"00:10:17 - 00:12:17: can use Pinecil's shorty-tips or any standardized TS-100 tip to get more precision—dependent on your soldering application, and while you've seen me using it thus far with a DC barrel jack, the Pinecil even supports USB-C PD! This thing is amazing and blows the door off of any other sub-$75 soldering iron. For literally 26 bucks. Buying one is basically legal theft. Ya know, not every gift has to be new and if you're running a Mac without a versioned or restorable backup, shame on you—especially since you can get an old Apple Time Capsule on eBay for less than $30. I got mine for $20 with a dead hard drive, and I was able to easily swap out the cheapo stock drive with a 2TB SATA SSD I bought from Amazon for $70. It's amazing how cheap SSDs have become. Now, the Time Capsule when released acted as a router and WiFi access point but I don't want either of those enabled because this thing is old... So, to make this a NAS, we're going to use an Ethernet cable from our router or switch and plug it into the WAN port on the Time Capsule. Then, we open AirPort Utility on our Mac or iPhone, select our Time Capsule, go to Wireless and turn it off. Then, we go into the network tab and set it to off or bridge mode so it doesn't try to create its own subnet and give us double NAT issues. We can still use the Time Capsule as a switch for other devices, but more importantly, we can now setup Time Machine and have all Macs on our network create versioned backups. We can even use it as a shared file or media server. I'm taking this 2TB all-flash NAS home—I mean, for less than $100, how could I say no?\\n\", '00:12:19 - 00:14:19: Meghan is better with a kitchen knife than I am so she naturally hates single-use kitchen gadgets and when she saw I got the Dreamfarm Garject, she rolled her eyes; but then, I used it, and she said \"okay, that\\'s actually really sick.\" Take a garlic clove, or multiple—papery peels and all—and load it into the Garject. Then, close the handle and see the garlic pressed through the holes with ease to a minced consistency—just like a regular garlic press. But now watch... upon opening the handles back up, the built-in scraper flicks all of the gooey garlic into your dish. Then, hitting the eject button removes the paper from the press and its ready for the dishwasher. It\\'s a brilliantly quick way to get through the stickiest, stinkiest part of your meal prep. Trust in the Germans to over-engineer the simplest hand-tool ever made—the screwdriver—with the WERA Kraftform Turbo. In its standard state, it\\'s just a screwdriver with a really sloppy shaft, but press the button at the back of the screwdriver, and you\\'ll enable turbo mode—a purely mechanical gear train that turns one rotation of the hand into 4 rotations of the shank. You can do this two handed or single-handed, but the end result is a lot less twisting while getting screws in and out a lot faster. Personally, I find this more effective than a ratcheting driver when I\\'ve got a lot of screws to burn through, though it doesn\\'t have a ton of torque, so for tightening or loosening past a few pound feet, you\\'ll want to push the button to re-enable standard driver mode. It\\'s absurdly unnecessary and I love it. I travel light and while I love the tiny 30W bricks that exist nowadays, they scratch the heck out of everything in my bag, so I\\'ve defaulted to Nomad\\'s Slim lineup of gallium nitride chargers.\\n', '00:14:21 - 00:16:21: They\\'ve got a single-port 35W and two-port 65W model—both tiny and lightweight, but more importantly, flat. Not only does this help avoid the scratchy-scratchy, but it also pushes the weight of the charger inwards so it doesn\\'t droop or fall out from loose, worn hotel outlets. I\\'ve owned my Playdate for a year-and-a-half, and they\\'re now just finally finishing their pre-order shipments to the point where you can buy one and actually get it soon. It\\'s a cute, little, yellow game console with a one-bit transflective LCD—there\\'s no backlight here—so it\\'s best viewed in the sun. I\\'ve never owned a literal one-bit screen before but I love it. Seeing the art style choices required to create the perception of \"white and black\" is super beautiful. In addition to USB-C, on-board WiFi, a rather decent speaker, and face buttons, it has a crank—which is silly but a fun mechanic in several of games that use it. So here\\'s the thing... Playdate is very expensive at $199. Now, much of that cost goes towards software because it does include 24 games that are unlocked once per week, every week, for 12 weeks; and, nearly all of the games are built by famous devs. Many of them are amazing, a few are just fine, some are long and several are short. Even taking the included games library into account, $200 is still nuts. My brain and wallet commands me to hate thing, but I just can\\'t. It\\'s absolutely whimsical, the games are innovative, it\\'s superb for quick 3-minute game sessions, and it\\'s so tiny you can take it with you everywhere.\\n', \"00:16:25 - 00:18:25: The community behind it is passionate and there's an enormous catalog of really great additional games that have been released for cheap and even oftentimes free—through both the Playdate Catalog store and Itch.io. It's the antithesis of cutting edge to the point of being obnoxiously hipster, but I don't care—it's so much fun, I adore it, and have for the nearly 2 years I've owned it. I love my Fluke 115 multimeter—it has saved me from getting electrocuted a bunch of times. But for $225, it doesn't really DO that much. The Australian-developed Pokit Pro on the other hand, very much does. It's a tiny little multimeter pen that uses a smartphone as a display screen. If this sounds dumb to you, I agree, but here's the thing... it's not just a multimeter. It's also an oscilloscope and data logger. And this isn't just a dumb-bum oscilloscope either—you can use functions to check frequency, RMS, period, average, duty, and more. You can even establish triggers to choose when and how a signal is captured. With wireless multi-channel support through a single app, you're off to the races for multiple-probe support and the built-in data logger is also sweet... you can take electrical or even temperature measurements using the onboard thermistor or and external NTC probe over an extended period of time—up to 6 months—all logged on-device and synced to the mobile app at a later date. You can now even setup range testing wherein you can establish measurement thresholds to quickly and easily identify passing spec by LED color and buzzer without needing to use a phone or display at all. If Pokit Pro is a bit pricey for you, most of the features are available on the even smaller Pokit Meter that you can get for less than $100. I don't think anything in this price comes even close to feature-set or\\n\", '00:18:28 - 00:20:28: size—and it more than makes up for having to awkwardly use a phone to see the data. If your significant other told you they bought a 9\" Unicorn Magnum Plus, what would you believe that to be? If you guessed a pepper mill, wow, you\\'re weird—but also, correct. The market is being flooded with nonsense $150+ salt and pepper mills made from machined aluminum and lemme tell you what: they suck compared to this ugly, plastic USA-made treasure. Compare the Magnum to my cheap but dependable OXO radial grinder or bougie Cole and Mason mill, and it disgraces their very existence. The Magnum can crack out a teaspoon of pepper with just 6 rotations. It makes so much pepper that it almost makes too much pepper. There isn\\'t much in the way of fine granular control, but it doesn\\'t matter because you can\\'t expect to tame 9\" hog. The Magnum sprays its love everywhere and you\\'d be lucky to own one. Seriously... they\\'re almost always sold out. When I first saw the Kinipex Cobra xtra-small pliers, I thought they were joke pliers. Like... seriously... these are tiny. What on earth could they be useful for? Dude... so many things. Despite being a mere 4\", there are 11 adjustment positions that open past 1 and 1/8ths inch—or... 28mm if you\\'re scared of fractions and freedom. Now, the shorter handles don\\'t give you insane leverage, but you get more than you need for most applications and the crazy number of adjustment positions in addition to the long jaw-tip length lets them often pull double-duty as an adjustable wrench. While you lack cutters, the pipe grips are sharp as all get out and bite into anything. These are German—and we already established they don\\'t mess around. I think the perfect gift is something\\n', \"00:20:29 - 00:22:29: that's just pricey enough you probably wouldn't buy it on your own volition but something you'd use all the time if received—at $30, these weirdo little pliers are that. End of story. And end of video—if you enjoyed this, please do give it a like. If you wanna pick something up, use the links in the description to send a small affiliate kick-back to Snazzy Labs if you don't mind—if you do mind and don't want to, that's okay too. I'm just grateful we were able to hang out—thanks for watching, and stay snazzy.\\n\"]\n",

You\\xa0\\xa0\\n00:10:17 - 00:12:17: can use Pinecil\\'s shorty-tips or any standardized\\xa0\\nTS-100 tip to get more precision—dependent on your\\xa0\\xa0 soldering application, and while you\\'ve seen\\xa0\\nme using it thus far with a DC barrel jack,\\xa0\\xa0 the Pinecil even supports USB-C PD! This\\xa0\\nthing is amazing and blows the door off of\\xa0\\xa0 any other sub-$75 soldering iron. For literally\\xa0\\n26 bucks. Buying one is basically legal theft. Ya know, not every gift has to be new and if\\xa0\\nyou\\'re running a Mac without a versioned or\\xa0\\xa0 restorable backup, shame on you—especially since\\xa0\\nyou can get an old Apple Time Capsule on eBay for\\xa0\\xa0 less than $30. I got mine for $20 with a dead\\xa0\\nhard drive, and I was able to easily swap out\\xa0\\xa0 the cheapo stock drive with a 2TB SATA SSD I\\xa0\\nbought from Amazon for $70. It\\'s amazing how\\xa0\\xa0 cheap SSDs have become. Now, the Time Capsule when\\xa0\\nreleased acted as a router and WiFi access point\\xa0\\xa0 but I don\\'t want either of those enabled because\\xa0\\nthis thing is old... So, to make this a NAS, we\\'re\\xa0\\xa0 going to use an Ethernet cable from our router or\\xa0\\nswitch and plug it into the WAN port on the Time\\xa0\\xa0 Capsule. Then, we open AirPort Utility on our Mac\\xa0\\nor iPhone, select our Time Capsule, go to Wireless\\xa0\\xa0 and turn it off. Then, we go into the network tab\\xa0\\nand set it to off or bridge mode so it doesn\\'t try\\xa0\\xa0 to create its own subnet and give us double NAT\\xa0\\nissues. We can still use the Time Capsule as a\\xa0\\xa0 switch for other devices, but more importantly,\\xa0\\nwe can now setup Time Machine and have all Macs\\xa0\\xa0 on our network create versioned backups. We\\xa0\\ncan even use it as a shared file or media\\xa0\\xa0 server. I\\'m taking this 2TB all-flash NAS home—I\\xa0\\nmean, for less than $100, how could I say no?\\n00:12:19 - 00:14:19: Meghan is better with a kitchen knife than I am so\\xa0\\nshe naturally hates single-use kitchen gadgets and\\xa0\\xa0 when she saw I got the Dreamfarm Garject, she\\xa0\\nrolled her eyes; but then, I used it, and she\\xa0\\xa0 said \"okay, that\\'s actually really sick.\" Take a\\xa0\\ngarlic clove, or multiple—papery peels and all—and\\xa0\\xa0 load it into the Garject. Then, close the handle\\xa0\\nand see the garlic pressed through the holes with\\xa0\\xa0 ease to a minced consistency—just like a regular\\xa0\\ngarlic press. But now watch... upon opening the\\xa0\\xa0 handles back up, the built-in scraper flicks\\xa0\\nall of the gooey garlic into your dish. Then,\\xa0\\xa0 hitting the eject button removes the paper from\\xa0\\nthe press and its ready for the dishwasher. It\\'s\\xa0\\xa0 a brilliantly quick way to get through the\\xa0\\nstickiest, stinkiest part of your meal prep. Trust in the Germans to over-engineer the simplest\\xa0\\nhand-tool ever made—the screwdriver—with the WERA\\xa0\\xa0 Kraftform Turbo. In its standard state, it\\'s\\xa0\\njust a screwdriver with a really sloppy shaft,\\xa0\\xa0 but press the button at the back of the\\xa0\\nscrewdriver, and you\\'ll enable turbo mode—a\\xa0\\xa0 purely mechanical gear train that turns\\xa0\\none rotation of the hand into 4 rotations\\xa0\\xa0 of the shank. You can do this two handed\\xa0\\nor single-handed, but the end result is a\\xa0\\xa0 lot less twisting while getting screws in and\\xa0\\nout a lot faster. Personally, I find this more\\xa0\\xa0 effective than a ratcheting driver when I\\'ve\\xa0\\ngot a lot of screws to burn through, though it\\xa0\\xa0 doesn\\'t have a ton of torque, so for tightening\\xa0\\nor loosening past a few pound feet, you\\'ll want\\xa0\\xa0 to push the button to re-enable standard driver\\xa0\\nmode. It\\'s absurdly unnecessary and I love it. I travel light and while I love the tiny 30W\\xa0\\nbricks that exist nowadays, they scratch the heck\\xa0\\xa0 out of everything in my bag, so I\\'ve defaulted to\\xa0\\nNomad\\'s Slim lineup of gallium nitride chargers.\\xa0\\xa0\\n00:14:21 - 00:16:21: They\\'ve got a single-port 35W and two-port\\xa0\\n65W model—both tiny and lightweight, but\\xa0\\xa0 more importantly, flat. Not only does this help\\xa0\\navoid the scratchy-scratchy, but it also pushes\\xa0\\xa0 the weight of the charger inwards so it doesn\\'t\\xa0\\ndroop or fall out from loose, worn hotel outlets. I\\'ve owned my Playdate for a year-and-a-half,\\xa0\\nand they\\'re now just finally finishing their\\xa0\\xa0 pre-order shipments to the point where you can buy\\xa0\\none and actually get it soon. It\\'s a cute, little,\\xa0\\xa0 yellow game console with a one-bit transflective\\xa0\\nLCD—there\\'s no backlight here—so it\\'s best viewed\\xa0\\xa0 in the sun. I\\'ve never owned a literal one-bit\\xa0\\nscreen before but I love it. Seeing the art style\\xa0\\xa0 choices required to create the perception\\xa0\\nof \"white and black\" is super beautiful. In\\xa0\\xa0 addition to USB-C, on-board WiFi, a rather decent\\xa0\\nspeaker, and face buttons, it has a crank—which\\xa0\\xa0 is silly but a fun mechanic in several of games\\xa0\\nthat use it. So here\\'s the thing... Playdate is\\xa0\\xa0 very expensive at $199. Now, much of that cost\\xa0\\ngoes towards software because it does include 24\\xa0\\xa0 games that are unlocked once per week, every week,\\xa0\\nfor 12 weeks; and, nearly all of the games are\\xa0\\xa0 built by famous devs. Many of them are amazing, a\\xa0\\nfew are just fine, some are long and several are\\xa0\\xa0 short. Even taking the included games library into\\xa0\\naccount, $200 is still nuts. My brain and wallet\\xa0\\xa0 commands me to hate thing, but I just can\\'t. It\\'s\\xa0\\nabsolutely whimsical, the games are innovative,\\xa0\\xa0 it\\'s superb for quick 3-minute game sessions, and\\xa0\\nit\\'s so tiny you can take it with you everywhere.\\xa0\\xa0\\n00:16:25 - 00:18:25: The community behind it is passionate and there\\'s\\xa0\\nan enormous catalog of really great additional\\xa0\\xa0 games that have been released for cheap and even\\xa0\\noftentimes free—through both the Playdate Catalog\\xa0\\xa0 store and Itch.io. It\\'s the antithesis of cutting\\xa0\\nedge to the point of being obnoxiously hipster,\\xa0\\xa0 but I don\\'t care—it\\'s so much fun, I adore it,\\xa0\\nand have for the nearly 2 years I\\'ve owned it. I love my Fluke 115 multimeter—it has saved\\xa0\\nme from getting electrocuted a bunch of times.\\xa0\\xa0 But for $225, it doesn\\'t really DO that much. The\\xa0\\nAustralian-developed Pokit Pro on the other hand,\\xa0\\xa0 very much does. It\\'s a tiny little multimeter\\xa0\\npen that uses a smartphone as a display screen.\\xa0\\xa0 If this sounds dumb to you, I agree, but here\\'s\\xa0\\nthe thing... it\\'s not just a multimeter. It\\'s\\xa0\\xa0 also an oscilloscope and data logger. And this\\xa0\\nisn\\'t just a dumb-bum oscilloscope either—you\\xa0\\xa0 can use functions to check frequency, RMS,\\xa0\\nperiod, average, duty, and more. You can\\xa0\\xa0 even establish triggers to choose when and how a\\xa0\\nsignal is captured. With wireless multi-channel\\xa0\\xa0 support through a single app, you\\'re off to\\xa0\\nthe races for multiple-probe support and the\\xa0\\xa0 built-in data logger is also sweet... you can take\\xa0\\nelectrical or even temperature measurements using\\xa0\\xa0 the onboard thermistor or and external NTC probe\\xa0\\nover an extended period of time—up to 6 months—all\\xa0\\xa0 logged on-device and synced to the mobile app at\\xa0\\na later date. You can now even setup range testing\\xa0\\xa0 wherein you can establish measurement thresholds\\xa0\\nto quickly and easily identify passing spec by LED\\xa0\\xa0 color and buzzer without needing to use a phone\\xa0\\nor display at all. If Pokit Pro is a bit pricey\\xa0\\xa0 for you, most of the features are available on the\\xa0\\neven smaller Pokit Meter that you can get for less\\xa0\\xa0 than $100. I don\\'t think anything in this\\xa0\\nprice comes even close to feature-set or\\xa0\\xa0\\n00:18:28 - 00:20:28: size—and it more than makes up for having\\xa0\\nto awkwardly use a phone to see the data. If your significant other told you they bought\\xa0\\na 9\" Unicorn Magnum Plus, what would you believe\\xa0\\xa0 that to be? If you guessed a pepper mill, wow,\\xa0\\nyou\\'re weird—but also, correct. The market is\\xa0\\xa0 being flooded with nonsense $150+ salt and pepper\\xa0\\nmills made from machined aluminum and lemme tell\\xa0\\xa0 you what: they suck compared to this ugly, plastic\\xa0\\nUSA-made treasure. Compare the Magnum to my cheap\\xa0\\xa0 but dependable OXO radial grinder or bougie\\xa0\\nCole and Mason mill, and it disgraces their very\\xa0\\xa0 existence. The Magnum can crack out a teaspoon\\xa0\\nof pepper with just 6 rotations. It makes so much\\xa0\\xa0 pepper that it almost makes too much pepper. There\\xa0\\nisn\\'t much in the way of fine granular control,\\xa0\\xa0 but it doesn\\'t matter because you can\\'t\\xa0\\nexpect to tame 9\" hog. The Magnum sprays\\xa0\\xa0 its love everywhere and you\\'d be lucky to own\\xa0\\none. Seriously... they\\'re almost always sold out. When I first saw the Kinipex Cobra xtra-small\\xa0\\npliers, I thought they were joke pliers. Like...\\xa0\\xa0 seriously... these are tiny. What on earth could\\xa0\\nthey be useful for? Dude... so many things.\\xa0\\xa0 Despite being a mere 4\", there are 11 adjustment\\xa0\\npositions that open past 1 and 1/8ths inch—or...\\xa0\\xa0 28mm if you\\'re scared of fractions and freedom.\\xa0\\nNow, the shorter handles don\\'t give you insane\\xa0\\xa0 leverage, but you get more than you need for most\\xa0\\napplications and the crazy number of adjustment\\xa0\\xa0 positions in addition to the long jaw-tip length\\xa0\\nlets them often pull double-duty as an adjustable\\xa0\\xa0 wrench. While you lack cutters, the pipe grips are\\xa0\\nsharp as all get out and bite into anything. These\\xa0\\xa0 are German—and we already established they don\\'t\\xa0\\nmess around. I think the perfect gift is something\\xa0\\xa0\\n00:20:29 - 00:22:29: that\\'s just pricey enough you probably wouldn\\'t\\xa0\\nbuy it on your own volition but something you\\'d\\xa0\\xa0 use all the time if received—at $30, these\\xa0\\nweirdo little pliers are that. End of story. And end of video—if you enjoyed this, please do\\xa0\\ngive it a like. If you wanna pick something up,\\xa0\\xa0 use the links in the description to\\xa0\\nsend a small affiliate kick-back to\\xa0\\xa0 Snazzy Labs if you don\\'t mind—if\\xa0\\nyou do mind and don\\'t want to,\\xa0\\xa0 that\\'s okay too.

      "[['00:00:00 - 00:02:00: Another year, another gift guide—without the expensive, sponsored crap you\\'ll see everywhere else. Gather round for legitimately cool gadgets you probably haven\\'t heard of—some of my favorites, and some of yours too. Oh, and save for one product, none of these are sponsored. I hate the multi-monitor lifestyle, but I do find myself wanting to place a static window on a smaller display—with the hilariously named Kwumsy K3, I can! This thing is an RGB mechanical keyboard, laptop I/O hub, SSD enclosure, and 13\" touchscreen—all in one. Supply it power, data, and video from your laptop or desktop and you\\'re off to the races. You\\'ve got access to the fairly bandwith-limited but still capable 5Gbps throughput for other USB devices, SD cards, and even an M.2-sized SSD. The keyboard is nice with surprisingly fancy double-shot PBT caps and less fancy generic yellow MX-style switches. That said, the switches are solderless so you can use the included tool to pop them right out and substitute your preferred combo. Neato. The screen is 1920x720 and has a luminance of 300 nits. It’s not fantastic—viewing angles are less than superb—but when angled right, looks better than the specs may suggest and having the ability to use it at any angle makes it the perfect 10-point multitouch sketch pad for Windows, a suitable social feed for macOS, and even a cyberdeck console for Raspberry Pi. All of us carry a flashlight around with us every day, but a smartphone is a pretty lousy one—this is the Aurora A8. It\\'s a teeny-tiny LED flashlight that brightens to an insane 650 lumens. Don\\'t know how bright that is? Well, here\\'s an iPhone 15 Pro,', \"00:02:01 - 00:04:01: and here's this little flashlight. Yeah, not only does the single button toggle through brightness settings, but it also has a UV light onboard to inspect currency and sketchy hotel rooms, it has a red light great for use when dark without losing night vision, it can flash if you have it attached to a backpack to alert cars of your presence, and it has a flood light to illuminate an area like a tent. It runs for hours on its internal battery, charges via USB-C, and comes with a clip, keyring, and magnetic base to attach to basically anything. It's amazing. If you're a 90s kid that grew up on Bop-It like I did, you'll love Flipslide. This cheap puzzle game has you flip and slide colored tiles to match those displayed on-screen. What sounds simple gets really intense with a variety of game modes from a simon-says-style mode to level mode which gives you increasingly less time as you progress and even multiplayer mode that had my wife and I laughing hysterically. It's perfect to play alone or with friends and priced the way it is, it's impossible to say no to. Get it. You should also get the Dyad Pro and S8 Pro Ultra from today's sponsor, Roborock. You may recall Roborock sponsored last year's gift guide—I personally sought them out to sponsor again this year because I love their products so much. The Dyad Pro is a cordless wet-dry vacuum that handles basically anything you can throw at it. Multiple brush rollers underneath the device wet and scrub your floor free of sticky, stainy grime within 1mm of walls and the powerful 17,000 pascal motor sucks up all of the waste—both wet and dry. The onboard DirTech smart sensor analyzes grime concentration on the rollers and adjusts water flow and suction accordingly to handle all tasks. Most wet-dry vacs are more hassle than they're worth, but not the Dyad Pro because\", \"00:04:06 - 00:06:06: upon returning it to its dock it self-cleans and hot-air dries the entire system making it ready day after day, week after week. There's even an onboard cleaning concentrate dispenser for scrubbing with surfactants, so you really only have to add clean water—and empty the dirty tank—when you feel like it. And the only thing better than a gadget that lessens work is one that removes it entirely—that's where the Roborock S8 Pro Ultra comes in. This vacuum is exceptional at its primary job—picking up debris—thanks to its dual-roller brush design and class-leading 6,000 pascal suction. This thing will get hair, crumbs, food, and more—from both hardwood and carpet. When the latter is detected, suction is boosted and the mop is raised so as to not touch rug and carpet fibers. Oh yeah, this thing mops too with its VibraRise system that scrubs the floor pretty aggressively removing a surprising amount of floor grime. When its finished its task, the bot returns to its all-in-one dock that empties the dust bin, washes the mop pad, hot-air dries said pad and station to avoid mildew, refills the on-board water tank, and charges the bot for its next journey. It's a great vacuum and mop, but the reason I've continued to use Roborock vacuums exclusively on the main floor of my home the past 4 years is the excellent, class-leading app and navigation system. Not only is it easy to issue commands and set schedules, but most importantly, my S8 Pro Ultra has vacuumed for nearly 200 hours since I got it earlier this year, and in the past month, it hasn't failed a route even once. It almost never gets stuck avoiding any obstacles placed before it, requires essentially zero maintenance, and keeps my floor clean for weeks before I have to think about lifting a finger. It's seriously one of the best tech gadgets I've ever owned—period. I love it and know you will too—be sure to check out\", '00:06:06 - 00:08:06: the S8 Pro Ultra and Dyad Pro while their Black Friday deals are ongoing using the links below. ISDT is a brand known to anyone that pilots drones or RC cars as they make some of the best LiPo battery chargers on the market. What I didn\\'t know until recently is that they also make an absolute chungus 200W USB charger. This thing has 3 type-C PD ports that can deliver 65/65/and a highly unusual, but amazing 140W—maxing out even the 16\" M3 Max MacBook Pro under full load while fast charging. Furthermore, the lone USB-A port supports up to 24W with support for all protocols like Qualcomm QuickCharge. A handsome LCD display reads out the wattage being pushed to each device including to the wireless charging pad which uses an MFi-certified MagSafe puck that pushes the full 15W of wireless power the iPhone is capable of. Given that making chargers is literally ISDT\\'s bread-and-butter, I was unsurprised but pleased to see quiet active cooling and overheat protection triggers. There’s even an app—if you want such a thing—and it comes with 2 high-quality 240W-capable Type-C cables. For the price they’re asking, it’s a steal. Wired headphones are back in amongst the youth, I hear, and the Questyle M15 is a must-have HiFi accessory for any wired headphones-listener. It\\'s a USB-C powered DAC and headphone amp in an insanely tiny package. In years past, this small size would suggest lousy amplification capabilities, but no... this thing is nuts: it can power my super inefficient Audeze LCD-3 just as well as larger headphone amps I\\'ve seen in the sub-$300 price range. Sound quality is fantastic, there\\'s insanely low noise floor to boot, it works with iOS and macOS, supports lossless audio of course, and is just... awesomely tiny.', '00:08:10 - 00:10:10: Moving to tiny things my wife loves... this micro ratchet wrench—I love it too! This thing is just 2\" long—like my pinkie. Any 1/4\" bit slips inside and can be ratcheted both left and right. It\\'s so small, it can basically be used as a screwdriver and in instances where you just don\\'t have clearance, well, stick the 1/4 bit in the opposite end and now you\\'ve got a stubby screwdriver. I\\'ve been keeping this with some bits in an Altoids tin in my backpack and it\\'s fabulously handy. I don\\'t like things on my phone so when Moft\\'s tripod stand was suggested to me by Joel, I knew I\\'d hate it. Well folks, I knew wrong—this thing is sweet. It snaps onto the back of your phone and unfolds in a cascading origami structure. You can set it up in a variety of different ways making it useful for vlogging, for video calls when using Continuity Camera, when watching movies, as a tripod for group photos and more. It\\'s light, way thinner than you\\'d think given its capabilities, and I love it—even if the price is a bit tough to swallow. Last year I mentioned Omnifixo, the perfect helping-hands companion for soldering. Many asked what iron I\\'d recommend for those new to soldering but I didn\\'t have an answer—at least not until I ordered a Pinecil earlier this year. This $26 soldering iron is incredible and punches way above its price tag. For starters, its entirely open-source and runs a risc-five CPU. Why on earth would you need this? Well, it gives you precise temperature control on the OLED display between 100 and 450 degrees celsius, it can reach said temperature in just 6 seconds, and automatically enters standby as soon as the on-board accelerometer stops detecting motion. You', \"00:10:17 - 00:12:17: can use Pinecil's shorty-tips or any standardized TS-100 tip to get more precision—dependent on your soldering application, and while you've seen me using it thus far with a DC barrel jack, the Pinecil even supports USB-C PD! This thing is amazing and blows the door off of any other sub-$75 soldering iron. For literally 26 bucks. Buying one is basically legal theft. Ya know, not every gift has to be new and if you're running a Mac without a versioned or restorable backup, shame on you—especially since you can get an old Apple Time Capsule on eBay for less than $30. I got mine for $20 with a dead hard drive, and I was able to easily swap out the cheapo stock drive with a 2TB SATA SSD I bought from Amazon for $70. It's amazing how cheap SSDs have become. Now, the Time Capsule when released acted as a router and WiFi access point but I don't want either of those enabled because this thing is old... So, to make this a NAS, we're going to use an Ethernet cable from our router or switch and plug it into the WAN port on the Time Capsule. Then, we open AirPort Utility on our Mac or iPhone, select our Time Capsule, go to Wireless and turn it off. Then, we go into the network tab and set it to off or bridge mode so it doesn't try to create its own subnet and give us double NAT issues. We can still use the Time Capsule as a switch for other devices, but more importantly, we can now setup Time Machine and have all Macs on our network create versioned backups.

Ya know, not every gift has to be new and if you're running a Mac without a versioned or restorable backup, shame on you—especially since you can get an old Apple Time Capsule on eBay for less than $30. I got mine for $20 with a dead hard drive, and I was able to easily swap out the cheapo stock drive with a 2TB SATA SSD I bought from Amazon for $70. It's amazing how cheap SSDs have become. Now, the Time Capsule when released acted as a router and WiFi access point but I don't want either of those enabled because this thing is old... So, to make this a NAS, we're going to use an Ethernet cable from our router or switch and plug it into the WAN port on the Time Capsule. Then, we open AirPort Utility on our Mac or iPhone, select our Time Capsule, go to Wireless and turn it off. Then, we go into the network tab and set it to off or bridge mode so it doesn't try to create its own subnet and give us double NAT issues. We can still use the Time Capsule as a switch for other devices, but more importantly, we can now setup Time Machine and have all Macs on our network create versioned backups. We can even use it as a shared file or media server. I'm taking this 2TB all-flash NAS home—I mean, for less than $100, how could I say no?\", '00:12:19 - 00:14:19: Meghan is better with a kitchen knife than I am so she naturally hates single-use kitchen gadgets and when she saw I got the Dreamfarm Garject, she rolled her eyes; but then, I used it, and she said \"okay, that\\'s actually really sick.\" Take a garlic clove, or multiple—papery peels and all—and load it into the Garject. Then, close the handle and see the garlic pressed through the holes with ease to a minced consistency—just like a regular garlic press. But now watch... upon opening the handles back up, the built-in scraper flicks all of the gooey garlic into your dish. Then, hitting the eject button removes the paper from the press and its ready for the dishwasher. It\\'s a brilliantly quick way to get through the stickiest, stinkiest part of your meal prep. Trust in the Germans to over-engineer the simplest hand-tool ever made—the screwdriver—with the WERA Kraftform Turbo. In its standard state, it\\'s just a screwdriver with a really sloppy shaft, but press the button at the back of the screwdriver, and you\\'ll enable turbo mode—a purely mechanical gear train that turns one rotation of the hand into 4 rotations of the shank. You can do this two handed or single-handed, but the end result is a lot less twisting while getting screws in and out a lot faster. Personally, I find this more effective than a ratcheting driver when I\\'ve got a lot of screws to burn through, though it doesn\\'t have a ton of torque, so for tightening or loosening past a few pound feet, you\\'ll want to push the button to re-enable standard driver mode. It\\'s absurdly unnecessary and I love it. I travel light and while I love the tiny 30W bricks that exist nowadays, they scratch the heck out of everything in my bag, so I\\'ve defaulted to Nomad\\'s Slim lineup of gallium nitride chargers.', '00:14:21 - 00:16:21: They\\'ve got a single-port 35W and two-port 65W model—both tiny and lightweight, but more importantly, flat. Not only does this help avoid the scratchy-scratchy, but it also pushes the weight of the charger inwards so it doesn\\'t droop or fall out from loose, worn hotel outlets. I\\'ve owned my Playdate for a year-and-a-half, and they\\'re now just finally finishing their pre-order shipments to the point where you can buy one and actually get it soon. It\\'s a cute, little, yellow game console with a one-bit transflective LCD—there\\'s no backlight here—so it\\'s best viewed in the sun. I\\'ve never owned a literal one-bit screen before but I love it. Seeing the art style choices required to create the perception of \"white and black\" is super beautiful. In addition to USB-C, on-board WiFi, a rather decent speaker, and face buttons, it has a crank—which is silly but a fun mechanic in several of games that use it. So here\\'s the thing... Playdate is very expensive at $199. Now, much of that cost goes towards software because it does include 24 games that are unlocked once per week, every week, for 12 weeks; and, nearly all of the games are built by famous devs. Many of them are amazing, a few are just fine, some are long and several are short. Even taking the included games library into account, $200 is still nuts. My brain and wallet commands me to hate thing, but I just can\\'t. It\\'s absolutely whimsical, the games are innovative, it\\'s superb for quick 3-minute game sessions, and it\\'s so tiny you can take it with you everywhere.', \"00:16:25 - 00:18:25: The community behind it is passionate and there's an enormous catalog of really great additional games that have been released for cheap and even oftentimes free—through both the Playdate Catalog store and Itch.io. It's the antithesis of cutting edge to the point of being obnoxiously hipster, but I don't care—it's so much fun, I adore it, and have for the nearly 2 years I've owned it. I love my Fluke 115 multimeter—it has saved me from getting electrocuted a bunch of times. But for $225, it doesn't really DO that much. The Australian-developed Pokit Pro on the other hand, very much does. It's a tiny little multimeter pen that uses a smartphone as a display screen. If this sounds dumb to you, I agree, but here's the thing... it's not just a multimeter. It's also an oscilloscope and data logger. And this isn't just a dumb-bum oscilloscope either—you can use functions to check frequency, RMS, period, average, duty, and more. You can even establish triggers to choose when and how a signal is captured. With wireless multi-channel support through a single app, you're off to the races for multiple-probe support and the built-in data logger is also sweet... you can take electrical or even temperature measurements using the onboard thermistor or and external NTC probe over an extended period of time—up to 6 months—all logged on-device and synced to the mobile app at a later date. You can now even setup range testing wherein you can establish measurement thresholds to quickly and easily identify passing spec by LED color and buzzer without needing to use a phone or display at all. If Pokit Pro is a bit pricey for you, most of the features are available on the even smaller Pokit Meter that you can get for less than $100. I don't think anything in this price comes even close to feature-set or\", '00:18:28 - 00:20:28: size—and it more than makes up for having to awkwardly use a phone to see the data. If your significant other told you they bought a 9\" Unicorn Magnum Plus, what would you believe that to be? If you guessed a pepper mill, wow, you\\'re weird—but also, correct. The market is being flooded with nonsense $150+ salt and pepper mills made from machined aluminum and lemme tell you what: they suck compared to this ugly, plastic USA-made treasure. Compare the Magnum to my cheap but dependable OXO radial grinder or bougie Cole and Mason mill, and it disgraces their very existence. The Magnum can crack out a teaspoon of pepper with just 6 rotations. It makes so much pepper that it almost makes too much pepper. There isn\\'t much in the way of fine granular control, but it doesn\\'t matter because you can\\'t expect to tame 9\" hog. The Magnum sprays its love everywhere and you\\'d be lucky to own one. Seriously... they\\'re almost always sold out. When I first saw the Kinipex Cobra xtra-small pliers, I thought they were joke pliers. Like... seriously... these are tiny. What on earth could they be useful for? Dude... so many things. Despite being a mere 4\", there are 11 adjustment positions that open past 1 and 1/8ths inch—or... 28mm if you\\'re scared of fractions and freedom. Now, the shorter handles don\\'t give you insane leverage, but you get more than you need for most applications and the crazy number of adjustment positions in addition to the long jaw-tip length lets them often pull double-duty as an adjustable wrench. While you lack cutters, the pipe grips are sharp as all get out and bite into anything. These are German—and we already established they don\\'t mess around. I think the perfect gift is something', \"00:20:29 - 00:22:29: that's just pricey enough you probably wouldn't buy it on your own volition but something you'd use all the time if received—at $30, these weirdo little pliers are that. End of story. And end of video—if you enjoyed this, please do give it a like.

      "00:30:26 - 00:30:29: we both find that really differently so\n",
      "00:30:28 - 00:30:31: yeah often we gravitate towards\n",
      "00:30:29 - 00:30:33: different staff and as much as we do\n",
      "00:30:31 - 00:30:34: climb so differently that climbing\n",

      "00:30:39 - 00:30:44: different body mechanics work for\n",
      "00:30:42 - 00:30:47: different problems yeah like that thing\n",
      "00:30:44 - 00:30:49: but anyway I hope it was fun to watch\n",

I hate the multi-monitor lifestyle, but I do find myself wanting to place a static window on a smaller display—with the hilariously named Kwumsy K3, I can! This thing is an RGB mechanical keyboard, laptop I/O hub, SSD enclosure, and 13\" touchscreen—all in one. Supply it power, data, and video from your laptop or desktop and you\\'re off to the races. You\\'ve got access to the fairly bandwith-limited but still capable 5Gbps throughput for other USB devices, SD cards, and even an M.2-sized SSD. The keyboard is nice with surprisingly fancy double-shot PBT caps and less fancy generic yellow MX-style switches. That said, the switches are solderless so you can use the included tool to pop them right out and substitute your preferred combo. Neato. The screen is 1920x720 and has a luminance of 300 nits. It’s not fantastic—viewing angles are less than superb—but when angled right, looks better than the specs may suggest and having the ability to use it at any angle makes it the perfect 10-point multitouch sketch pad for Windows, a suitable social feed for macOS, and even a cyberdeck console for Raspberry Pi. All of us carry a flashlight around with us every day, but a smartphone is a pretty lousy one—this is the Aurora A8. It\\'s a teeny-tiny LED flashlight that brightens to an insane 650 lumens. Don\\'t know how bright that is? Well, here\\'s an iPhone 15 Pro,'), (datetime.datetime(1900, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1), datetime.datetime(1900, 1, 1, 0, 4, 1), \"and here's this little flashlight. Yeah, not only does the single button toggle through brightness settings, but it also has a UV light onboard to inspect currency and sketchy hotel rooms, it has a red light great for use when dark without losing night vision, it can flash if you have it attached to a backpack to alert cars of your presence, and it has a flood light to illuminate an area like a tent. It runs for hours on its internal battery, charges via USB-C, and comes with a clip, keyring, and magnetic base to attach to basically anything. It's amazing. If you're a 90s kid that grew up on Bop-It like I did, you'll love Flipslide. This cheap puzzle game has you flip and slide colored tiles to match those displayed on-screen. What sounds simple gets really intense with a variety of game modes from a simon-says-style mode to level mode which gives you increasingly less time as you progress and even multiplayer mode that had my wife and I laughing hysterically. It's perfect to play alone or with friends and priced the way it is, it's impossible to say no to. Get it. You should also get the Dyad Pro and S8 Pro Ultra from today's sponsor, Roborock. You may recall Roborock sponsored last year's gift guide—I personally sought them out to sponsor again this year because I love their products so much. The Dyad Pro is a cordless wet-dry vacuum that handles basically anything you can throw at it. Multiple brush rollers underneath the device wet and scrub your floor free of sticky, stainy grime within 1mm of walls and the powerful 17,000 pascal motor sucks up all of the waste—both wet and dry. The onboard DirTech smart sensor analyzes grime concentration on the rollers and adjusts water flow and suction accordingly to handle all tasks. Most wet-dry vacs are more hassle than they're worth, but not the Dyad Pro because\"), (datetime.datetime(1900, 1, 1, 0, 4, 6), datetime.datetime(1900, 1, 1, 0, 6, 6), \"upon returning it to its dock it self-cleans and hot-air dries the entire system making it ready day after day, week after week. There's even an onboard cleaning concentrate dispenser for scrubbing with surfactants, so you really only have to add clean water—and empty the dirty tank—when you feel like it. And the only thing better than a gadget that lessens work is one that removes it entirely—that's where the Roborock S8 Pro Ultra comes in. This vacuum is exceptional at its primary job—picking up debris—thanks to its dual-roller brush design and class-leading 6,000 pascal suction. This thing will get hair, crumbs, food, and more—from both hardwood and carpet. When the latter is detected, suction is boosted and the mop is raised so as to not touch rug and carpet fibers. Oh yeah, this thing mops too with its VibraRise system that scrubs the floor pretty aggressively removing a surprising amount of floor grime. When its finished its task, the bot returns to its all-in-one dock that empties the dust bin, washes the mop pad, hot-air dries said pad and station to avoid mildew, refills the on-board water tank, and charges the bot for its next journey. It's a great vacuum and mop, but the reason I've continued to use Roborock vacuums exclusively on the main floor of my home the past 4 years is the excellent, class-leading app and navigation system. Not only is it easy to issue commands and set schedules, but most importantly, my S8 Pro Ultra has vacuumed for nearly 200 hours since I got it earlier this year, and in the past month, it hasn't failed a route even once. It almost never gets stuck avoiding any obstacles placed before it, requires essentially zero maintenance, and keeps my floor clean for weeks before I have to think about lifting a finger. It's seriously one of the best tech gadgets I've ever owned—period.

ISDT is a brand known to anyone that pilots drones or RC cars as they make some of the best LiPo battery chargers on the market. What I didn\\'t know until recently is that they also make an absolute chungus 200W USB charger. This thing has 3 type-C PD ports that can deliver 65/65/and a highly unusual, but amazing 140W—maxing out even the 16\" M3 Max MacBook Pro under full load while fast charging. Furthermore, the lone USB-A port supports up to 24W with support for all protocols like Qualcomm QuickCharge. A handsome LCD display reads out the wattage being pushed to each device including to the wireless charging pad which uses an MFi-certified MagSafe puck that pushes the full 15W of wireless power the iPhone is capable of. Given that making chargers is literally ISDT\\'s bread-and-butter, I was unsurprised but pleased to see quiet active cooling and overheat protection triggers. There’s even an app—if you want such a thing—and it comes with 2 high-quality 240W-capable Type-C cables. For the price they’re asking, it’s a steal. Wired headphones are back in amongst the youth, I hear, and the Questyle M15 is a must-have HiFi accessory for any wired headphones-listener. It\\'s a USB-C powered DAC and headphone amp in an insanely tiny package. In years past, this small size would suggest lousy amplification capabilities, but no... this thing is nuts: it can power my super inefficient Audeze LCD-3 just as well as larger headphone amps I\\'ve seen in the sub-$300 price range. Sound quality is fantastic, there\\'s insanely low noise floor to boot, it works with iOS and macOS, supports lossless audio of course, and is just... awesomely tiny.'), (datetime.datetime(1900, 1, 1, 0, 8, 10), datetime.datetime(1900, 1, 1, 0, 10, 10), 'Moving to tiny things my wife loves... this micro ratchet wrench—I love it too!

It\\'s so small, it can basically be used as a screwdriver and in instances where you just don\\'t have clearance, well, stick the 1/4 bit in the opposite end and now you\\'ve got a stubby screwdriver. I\\'ve been keeping this with some bits in an Altoids tin in my backpack and it\\'s fabulously handy. I don\\'t like things on my phone so when Moft\\'s tripod stand was suggested to me by Joel, I knew I\\'d hate it. Well folks, I knew wrong—this thing is sweet. It snaps onto the back of your phone and unfolds in a cascading origami structure. You can set it up in a variety of different ways making it useful for vlogging, for video calls when using Continuity Camera, when watching movies, as a tripod for group photos and more. It\\'s light, way thinner than you\\'d think given its capabilities, and I love it—even if the price is a bit tough to swallow. Last year I mentioned Omnifixo, the perfect helping-hands companion for soldering. Many asked what iron I\\'d recommend for those new to soldering but I didn\\'t have an answer—at least not until I ordered a Pinecil earlier this year. This $26 soldering iron is incredible and punches way above its price tag. For starters, its entirely open-source and runs a risc-five CPU. Why on earth would you need this? Well, it gives you precise temperature control on the OLED display between 100 and 450 degrees celsius, it can reach said temperature in just 6 seconds, and automatically enters standby as soon as the on-board accelerometer stops detecting motion.

This thing is amazing and blows the door off of any other sub-$75 soldering iron. For literally 26 bucks. Buying one is basically legal theft. Ya know, not every gift has to be new and if you're running a Mac without a versioned or restorable backup, shame on you—especially since you can get an old Apple Time Capsule on eBay for less than $30. I got mine for $20 with a dead hard drive, and I was able to easily swap out the cheapo stock drive with a 2TB SATA SSD I bought from Amazon for $70. It's amazing how cheap SSDs have become. Now, the Time Capsule when released acted as a router and WiFi access point but I don't want either of those enabled because this thing is old... So, to make this a NAS, we're going to use an Ethernet cable from our router or switch and plug it into the WAN port on the Time Capsule. Then, we open AirPort Utility on our Mac or iPhone, select our Time Capsule, go to Wireless and turn it off. Then, we go into the network tab and set it to off or bridge mode so it doesn't try to create its own subnet and give us double NAT issues. We can still use the Time Capsule as a switch for other devices, but more importantly, we can now setup Time Machine and have all Macs on our network create versioned backups. We can even use it as a shared file or media server.

Then, close the handle and see the garlic pressed through the holes with ease to a minced consistency—just like a regular garlic press. But now watch... upon opening the handles back up, the built-in scraper flicks all of the gooey garlic into your dish. Then, hitting the eject button removes the paper from the press and its ready for the dishwasher. It\\'s a brilliantly quick way to get through the stickiest, stinkiest part of your meal prep. Trust in the Germans to over-engineer the simplest hand-tool ever made—the screwdriver—with the WERA Kraftform Turbo. In its standard state, it\\'s just a screwdriver with a really sloppy shaft, but press the button at the back of the screwdriver, and you\\'ll enable turbo mode—a purely mechanical gear train that turns one rotation of the hand into 4 rotations of the shank. You can do this two handed or single-handed, but the end result is a lot less twisting while getting screws in and out a lot faster. Personally, I find this more effective than a ratcheting driver when I\\'ve got a lot of screws to burn through, though it doesn\\'t have a ton of torque, so for tightening or loosening past a few pound feet, you\\'ll want to push the button to re-enable standard driver mode. It\\'s absurdly unnecessary and I love it.

I\\'ve owned my Playdate for a year-and-a-half, and they\\'re now just finally finishing their pre-order shipments to the point where you can buy one and actually get it soon. It\\'s a cute, little, yellow game console with a one-bit transflective LCD—there\\'s no backlight here—so it\\'s best viewed in the sun.

In addition to USB-C, on-board WiFi, a rather decent speaker, and face buttons, it has a crank—which is silly but a fun mechanic in several of games that use it. So here\\'s the thing... Playdate is very expensive at $199. Now, much of that cost goes towards software because it does include 24 games that are unlocked once per week, every week, for 12 weeks; and, nearly all of the games are built by famous devs. Many of them are amazing, a few are just fine, some are long and several are short. Even taking the included games library into account, $200 is still nuts. My brain and wallet commands me to hate thing, but I just can\\'t.

The Australian-developed Pokit Pro on the other hand, very much does. It's a tiny little multimeter pen that uses a smartphone as a display screen. If this sounds dumb to you, I agree, but here's the thing... it's not just a multimeter. It's also an oscilloscope and data logger. And this isn't just a dumb-bum oscilloscope either—you can use functions to check frequency, RMS, period, average, duty, and more. You can even establish triggers to choose when and how a signal is captured. With wireless multi-channel support through a single app, you're off to the races for multiple-probe support and the built-in data logger is also sweet... you can take electrical or even temperature measurements using the onboard thermistor or and external NTC probe over an extended period of time—up to 6 months—all logged on-device and synced to the mobile app at a later date. You can now even setup range testing wherein you can establish measurement thresholds to quickly and easily identify passing spec by LED color and buzzer without needing to use a phone or display at all.

The market is being flooded with nonsense $150+ salt and pepper mills made from machined aluminum and lemme tell you what: they suck compared to this ugly, plastic USA-made treasure. Compare the Magnum to my cheap but dependable OXO radial grinder or bougie Cole and Mason mill, and it disgraces their very existence.

If you\\'re a 90s kid that grew up on Bop-It like I did, you\\'ll love Flipslide. This cheap puzzle game has you flip and slide colored tiles to match those displayed on-screen. What sounds simple gets really intense with a variety of game modes from a simon-says-style mode to level mode which gives you increasingly less time as you progress and even multiplayer mode that had my wife and I laughing hysterically. It\\'s perfect to play alone or with friends and priced the way it is, it\\'s impossible to say no to. Get it. You should also get the Dyad Pro and S8 Pro Ultra from today\\'s sponsor, Roborock. You may recall Roborock sponsored last year\\'s gift guide—I personally sought them out to sponsor again this year because I love their products so much. The Dyad Pro is a cordless wet-dry vacuum that handles basically anything you can throw at it. Multiple brush rollers underneath the device wet and scrub your floor free of sticky, stainy grime within 1mm of walls and the powerful 17,000 pascal motor sucks up all of the waste—both wet and dry. The onboard DirTech smart sensor analyzes grime concentration on the rollers and adjusts water flow and suction accordingly to handle all tasks. Most wet-dry vacs are more hassle than they\\'re worth, but not the Dyad Pro because\\n00:04:06 - 00:06:06: upon returning it to its dock it self-cleans and hot-air dries the entire system making it ready day after day, week after week. There\\'s even an onboard cleaning concentrate dispenser for scrubbing with surfactants, so you really only have to add clean water—and empty the dirty tank—when you feel like it. And the only thing better than a gadget that lessens work is one that removes it entirely—that\\'s where the Roborock S8 Pro Ultra comes in. This vacuum is exceptional at its primary job—picking up debris—thanks to its dual-roller brush design and class-leading 6,000 pascal suction. This thing will get hair, crumbs, food, and more—from both hardwood and carpet. When the latter is detected, suction is boosted and the mop is raised so as to not touch rug and carpet fibers. Oh yeah, this thing mops too with its VibraRise system that scrubs the floor pretty aggressively removing a surprising amount of floor grime. When its finished its task, the bot returns to its all-in-one dock that empties the dust bin, washes the mop pad, hot-air dries said pad and station to avoid mildew, refills the on-board water tank, and charges the bot for its next journey. It\\'s a great vacuum and mop, but the reason I\\'ve continued to use Roborock vacuums exclusively on the main floor of my home the past 4 years is the excellent, class-leading app and navigation system. Not only is it easy to issue commands and set schedules, but most importantly, my S8 Pro Ultra has vacuumed for nearly 200 hours since I got it earlier this year, and in the past month, it hasn\\'t failed a route even once. It almost never gets stuck avoiding any obstacles placed before it, requires essentially zero maintenance, and keeps my floor clean for weeks before I have to think about lifting a finger. It\\'s seriously one of the best tech gadgets I\\'ve ever owned—period. I love it and know you will too—be sure to check out\\n00:06:06 - 00:08:06: the S8 Pro Ultra and Dyad Pro while their Black Friday deals are ongoing using the links below. ISDT is a brand known to anyone that pilots drones or RC cars as they make some of the best LiPo battery chargers on the market. What I didn\\'t know until recently is that they also make an absolute chungus 200W USB charger. This thing has 3 type-C PD ports that can deliver 65/65/and a highly unusual, but amazing 140W—maxing out even the 16\" M3 Max MacBook Pro under full load while fast charging. Furthermore, the lone USB-A port supports up to 24W with support for all protocols like Qualcomm QuickCharge. A handsome LCD display reads out the wattage being pushed to each device including to the wireless charging pad which uses an MFi-certified MagSafe puck that pushes the full 15W of wireless power the iPhone is capable of. Given that making chargers is literally ISDT\\'s bread-and-butter, I was unsurprised but pleased to see quiet active cooling and overheat protection triggers. There’s even an app—if you want such a thing—and it comes with 2 high-quality 240W-capable Type-C cables. For the price they’re asking, it’s a steal. Wired headphones are back in amongst the youth, I hear, and the Questyle M15 is a must-have HiFi accessory for any wired headphones-listener. It\\'s a USB-C powered DAC and headphone amp in an insanely tiny package. In years past, this small size would suggest lousy amplification capabilities, but no... this thing is nuts: it can power my super inefficient Audeze LCD-3 just as well as larger headphone amps I\\'ve seen in the sub-$300 price range. Sound quality is fantastic, there\\'s insanely low noise floor to boot, it works with iOS and macOS, supports lossless audio of course, and is just... awesomely tiny.\\n00:08:10 - 00:10:10: Moving to tiny things my wife loves... this micro ratchet wrench—I love it too! This thing is just 2\" long—like my pinkie. Any 1/4\" bit slips inside and can be ratcheted both left and right. It\\'s so small, it can basically be used as a screwdriver and in instances where you just don\\'t have clearance, well, stick the 1/4 bit in the opposite end and now you\\'ve got a stubby screwdriver. I\\'ve been keeping this with some bits in an Altoids tin in my backpack and it\\'s fabulously handy. I don\\'t like things on my phone so when Moft\\'s tripod stand was suggested to me by Joel, I knew I\\'d hate it. Well folks, I knew wrong—this thing is sweet. It snaps onto the back of your phone and unfolds in a cascading origami structure. You can set it up in a variety of different ways making it useful for vlogging, for video calls when using Continuity Camera, when watching movies, as a tripod for group photos and more. It\\'s light, way thinner than you\\'d think given its capabilities, and I love it—even if the price is a bit tough to swallow. Last year I mentioned Omnifixo, the perfect helping-hands companion for soldering. Many asked what iron I\\'d recommend for those new to soldering but I didn\\'t have an answer—at least not until I ordered a Pinecil earlier this year. This $26 soldering iron is incredible and punches way above its price tag. For starters, its entirely open-source and runs a risc-five CPU. Why on earth would you need this? Well, it gives you precise temperature control on the OLED display between 100 and 450 degrees celsius, it can reach said temperature in just 6 seconds, and automatically enters standby as soon as the on-board accelerometer stops detecting motion. You\\n00:10:17 - 00:12:17: can use Pinecil\\'s shorty-tips or any standardized TS-100 tip to get more precision—dependent on your soldering application, and while you\\'ve seen me using it thus far with a DC barrel jack, the Pinecil even supports USB-C PD! This thing is amazing and blows the door off of any other sub-$75 soldering iron. For literally 26 bucks. Buying one is basically legal theft. Ya know, not every gift has to be new and if you\\'re running a Mac without a versioned or restorable backup, shame on you—especially since you can get an old Apple Time Capsule on eBay for less than $30. I got mine for $20 with a dead hard drive, and I was able to easily swap out the cheapo stock drive with a 2TB SATA SSD I bought from Amazon for $70. It\\'s amazing how cheap SSDs have become. Now, the Time Capsule when released acted as a router and WiFi access point but I don\\'t want either of those enabled because this thing is old... So, to make this a NAS, we\\'re going to use an Ethernet cable from our router or switch and plug it into the WAN port on the Time Capsule. Then, we open AirPort Utility on our Mac or iPhone, select our Time Capsule, go to Wireless and turn it off. Then, we go into the network tab and set it to off or bridge mode so it doesn\\'t try to create its own subnet and give us double NAT issues. We can still use the Time Capsule as a switch for other devices, but more importantly, we can now setup Time Machine and have all Macs on our network create versioned backups. We can even use it as a shared file or media server. I\\'m taking this 2TB all-flash NAS home—I mean, for less than $100, how could I say no?\\n00:12:19 - 00:14:19: Meghan is better with a kitchen knife than I am so she naturally hates single-use kitchen gadgets and when she saw I got the Dreamfarm Garject, she rolled her eyes; but then, I used it, and she said \"okay, that\\'s actually really sick.\" Take a garlic clove, or multiple—papery peels and all—and load it into the Garject. Then, close the handle and see the garlic pressed through the holes with ease to a minced consistency—just like a regular garlic press. But now watch... upon opening the handles back up, the built-in scraper flicks all of the gooey garlic into your dish. Then, hitting the eject button removes the paper from the press and its ready for the dishwasher. It\\'s a brilliantly quick way to get through the stickiest, stinkiest part of your meal prep. Trust in the Germans to over-engineer the simplest hand-tool ever made—the screwdriver—with the WERA Kraftform Turbo. In its standard state, it\\'s just a screwdriver with a really sloppy shaft, but press the button at the back of the screwdriver, and you\\'ll enable turbo mode—a purely mechanical gear train that turns one rotation of the hand into 4 rotations of the shank. You can do this two handed or single-handed, but the end result is a lot less twisting while getting screws in and out a lot faster. Personally, I find this more effective than a ratcheting driver when I\\'ve got a lot of screws to burn through, though it doesn\\'t have a ton of torque, so for tightening or loosening past a few pound feet, you\\'ll want to push the button to re-enable standard driver mode. It\\'s absurdly unnecessary and I love it. I travel light and while I love the tiny 30W bricks that exist nowadays, they scratch the heck out of everything in my bag, so I\\'ve defaulted to Nomad\\'s Slim lineup of gallium nitride chargers.\\n00:14:21 - 00:16:21: They\\'ve got a single-port 35W and two-port 65W model—both tiny and lightweight, but more importantly, flat. Not only does this help avoid the scratchy-scratchy, but it also pushes the weight of the charger inwards so it doesn\\'t droop or fall out from loose, worn hotel outlets. I\\'ve owned my Playdate for a year-and-a-half, and they\\'re now just finally finishing their pre-order shipments to the point where you can buy one and actually get it soon. It\\'s a cute, little, yellow game console with a one-bit transflective LCD—there\\'s no backlight here—so it\\'s best viewed in the sun. I\\'ve never owned a literal one-bit screen before but I love it. Seeing the art style choices required to create the perception of \"white and black\" is super beautiful. In addition to USB-C, on-board WiFi, a rather decent speaker, and face buttons, it has a crank—which is silly but a fun mechanic in several of games that use it. So here\\'s the thing... Playdate is very expensive at $199. Now, much of that cost goes towards software because it does include 24 games that are unlocked once per week, every week, for 12 weeks; and, nearly all of the games are built by famous devs. Many of them are amazing, a few are just fine, some are long and several are short. Even taking the included games library into account, $200 is still nuts. My brain and wallet commands me to hate thing, but I just can\\'t. It\\'s absolutely whimsical, the games are innovative, it\\'s superb for quick 3-minute game sessions, and it\\'s so tiny you can take it with you everywhere.\\n00:16:25 - 00:18:25: The community behind it is passionate and there\\'s an enormous catalog of really great additional games that have been released for cheap and even oftentimes free—through both the Playdate Catalog store and Itch.io. It\\'s the antithesis of cutting edge to the point of being obnoxiously hipster, but I don\\'t care—it\\'s so much fun, I adore it, and have for the nearly 2 years I\\'ve owned it. I love my Fluke 115 multimeter—it has saved me from getting electrocuted a bunch of times. But for $225, it doesn\\'t really DO that much. The Australian-developed Pokit Pro on the other hand, very much does. It\\'s a tiny little multimeter pen that uses a smartphone as a display screen. If this sounds dumb to you, I agree, but here\\'s the thing... it\\'s not just a multimeter. It\\'s also an oscilloscope and data logger. And this isn\\'t just a dumb-bum oscilloscope either—you can use functions to check frequency, RMS, period, average, duty, and more. You can even establish triggers to choose when and how a signal is captured. With wireless multi-channel support through a single app, you\\'re off to the races for multiple-probe support and the built-in data logger is also sweet... you can take electrical or even temperature measurements using the onboard thermistor or and external NTC probe over an extended period of time—up to 6 months—all logged on-device and synced to the mobile app at a later date. You can now even setup range testing wherein you can establish measurement thresholds to quickly and easily identify passing spec by LED color and buzzer without needing to use a phone or display at all. If Pokit Pro is a bit pricey for you, most of the features are available on the even smaller Pokit Meter that you can get for less than $100. I don\\'t think anything in this price comes even close to feature-set or\\n00:18:28 - 00:20:28: size—and it more than makes up for having to awkwardly use a phone to see the data. If your significant other told you they bought a 9\" Unicorn Magnum Plus, what would you believe that to be? If you guessed a pepper mill, wow, you\\'re weird—but also, correct. The market is being flooded with nonsense $150+ salt and pepper mills made from machined aluminum and lemme tell you what: they suck compared to this ugly, plastic USA-made treasure. Compare the Magnum to my cheap but dependable OXO radial grinder or bougie Cole and Mason mill, and it disgraces their very existence. The Magnum can crack out a teaspoon of pepper with just 6 rotations. It makes so much pepper that it almost makes too much pepper. There isn\\'t much in the way of fine granular control, but it doesn\\'t matter because you can\\'t expect to tame 9\" hog. The Magnum sprays its love everywhere and you\\'d be lucky to own one. Seriously... they\\'re almost always sold out. When I first saw the Kinipex Cobra xtra-small pliers, I thought they were joke pliers. Like... seriously... these are tiny. What on earth could they be useful for? Dude... so many things. Despite being a mere 4\", there are 11 adjustment positions that open past 1 and 1/8ths inch—or... 28mm if you\\'re scared of fractions and freedom. Now, the shorter handles don\\'t give you insane leverage, but you get more than you need for most applications and the crazy number of adjustment positions in addition to the long jaw-tip length lets them often pull double-duty as an adjustable wrench. While you lack cutters, the pipe grips are sharp as all get out and bite into anything. These are German—and we already established they don\\'t mess around.

00:00:32: the other week i was in an area called ', '00:00:30 - 00:00:34: canderstig looking for a very specific ', '00:00:32 - 00:00:35: climb that i was really psyched on and i ', '00:00:34 - 00:00:37: got quite obsessed and spent a total of ', '00:00:35 - 00:00:40: seven hours looking for this boulder ', \"00:00:37 - 00:00:42: only to find out from a person that it's \", '00:00:40 - 00:00:44: one illegal to climb on it this season ', '00:00:42 - 00:00:46: of the year and two ', '00:00:44 - 00:00:48: it is in a different area than i was ', \"00:00:46 - 00:00:50: looking in so that's basically the \", \"00:00:48 - 00:00:52: problem with when cracks aren't well \", '00:00:50 - 00:00:54: documented and as a contrast to that ', \"00:00:52 -

00:02:01: it has a few hard moves like the first ', '00:01:59 - 00:02:04: moves pretty hard ', '00:02:01 - 00:02:05: um you go out to this really sloppy ', '00:02:04 - 00:02:07: thing for your left hand there are some ', '00:02:05 - 00:02:09: other betas but i have an injured knee ', \"00:02:07 - 00:02:11: so i can't really do those um \", '00:02:09 - 00:02:12: anyways and then you do a really hard ', '00:02:11 - 00:02:15: intense toe hook and from like this ', '00:02:12 - 00:02:17: weird sloper thing you go do a big move ', '00:02:15 - 00:02:18: to uh ', '00:02:17 - 00:02:20: kind of ', \"00:02:18 - 00:02:23: how to put it it's like this \", '00:02:20 - 00:02:25: really um polished right hand ', \"00:02:23 -

00:02:44: horrible sloper to hold in the summer ', \"00:02:41 - 00:02:46: that exists it's actually known as being \", '00:02:44 - 00:02:48: the anti-summer sloper by one of the ', '00:02:46 - 00:02:49: locals and i guess many other locals ', \"00:02:48 - 00:02:51: here because it's like \", \"00:02:49 - 00:02:52: this boulder you don't want to do it in \", '00:02:51 - 00:02:55: the summer but i also have like a little ', '00:02:52 - 00:02:57: bit of margin on it i feel like so yeah ', \"00:02:55 - 00:02:58: just it's fun to get on something that \", '00:02:57 - 00:02:59: works with the heel like pretty much ', '00:02:58 - 00:03:01: everything around here is very right ', '00:02:59 - 00:03:03: heel intense so i have to have this knee ', '00:03:01 -

00:04:40: i was really starting to doubt it would ', '00:04:38 - 00:04:42: go quite quickly into the session ', '00:04:40 - 00:04:43: it was just way too slippery so i was ', '00:04:42 - 00:04:45: like ', \"00:04:43 - 00:04:47: this is i'm screwed this is definitely \", '00:04:45 - 00:04:48: not gonna go and then i think i just ', '00:04:47 - 00:04:50: found a really good flow and it felt ', \"00:04:48 - 00:04:51: yeah it just felt good there's like this \", '00:04:50 - 00:04:53: little thing in the beginning of the ', '00:04:51 - 00:04:54: bowler where you can kind of dab a rock ', \"00:04:53 - 00:04:56: and i've done that a few times and then \", '00:04:54 - 00:04:57: kept going just like whatever but this ', '00:04:56 - 00:04:59: time i managed to avoid it and i think ', '00:04:57 - 00:05:00: it gave me a little bit of extra psych ', '00:04:59 - 00:05:02: and movement because i just felt like ', \"00:05:00 - 00:05:04: okay it's fully legit let's go let's get \", '00:05:02 - 00:05:06: it done and uh ', \"00:05:04 - 00:05:07: yeah that was awesome we're gonna move \", '00:05:06 - 00:05:09: over to some other hard boulders and get ', '00:05:07 - 00:05:11: some more climbing done now and yeah ', \"00:05:09 - 00:05:13: riders of the storm an ap i'm just gonna \", '00:05:11 - 00:05:15: try to do the second part first and then ', '00:05:13 - 00:05:16: try and link it from the start feels ', '00:05:15 - 00:05:18: really really good i just warmed up a ', '00:05:16 - 00:05:19: little bit on the moves and i think it ', \"00:05:18 - 00:05:21: could go but let's start with the top \", '00:05:19 - 00:05:25: section and try and get that dialed and ', '00:05:21 - 00:05:25: then give it a burn from the bottom ', '00:05:46 - 00:05:50: all right ', \"00:05:48 - 00:05:52: it's basically the top section \", '00:05:50 - 00:05:54: give it a go from the bottom ', '00:05:52 - 00:05:56: i felt very good i will say though ', \"00:05:54 - 00:05:57: there's this one move \", '00:05:56 - 00:05:59: here ', \"00:05:57 - 00:06:02: where i'm really stretched out \", '00:05:59 - 00:06:04: and i bumped from this hole to this hold ', '00:06:02 - 00:06:05: which is by far the crux for me ', '00:06:04 - 00:06:07: because you want to be a little bit ', \"00:06:05 - 00:06:09: taller than i am there if you're doing \", '00:06:07 - 00:06:10: that beta but it just barely works like ', '00:06:09 - 00:06:13: i tried it when i was warming up and i ', '00:06:10 - 00:06:14: did it on the first go so ', \"00:06:13 - 00:06:16: i'm feeling positive but that's \", '00:06:14 - 00:06:18: definitely where i can kind of just get ', '00:06:16 - 00:06:20: punted off the boulder yeah rest up and ', \"00:06:18 - 00:06:23: then try and do it let's go let's get it \", '00:06:20 - 00:06:23: done ', '00:06:34 - 00:06:38: okay ', '00:06:36 - 00:06:40: nothing goes without a little fight ', '00:06:38 - 00:06:42: i was pretty close but i uh ', '00:06:40 - 00:06:43: moved my feet a little bit incorrectly ', '00:06:42 - 00:06:44: in the start ', '00:06:43 - 00:06:46: got me slightly more tired than i wanted ', '00:06:44 - 00:06:47: to be ', \"00:06:46 - 00:06:48: and then i didn't tense my bicep enough \", '00:06:47 - 00:06:52: on the right arm ', '00:06:48 - 00:06:52: next go ', '00:07:05 - 00:07:08: uh ', '00:07:25 - 00:07:28: oh ', '00:07:36 - 00:07:42: oh my god you look so solid on it yeah ', '00:07:39 - 00:07:46: yeah yeah that felt super good ', \"00:07:42 - 00:07:46: on to the next boulder let's go \", '00:07:47 - 00:07:51: after riders i wanted to give a go at ', '00:07:49 - 00:07:53: the infamous practice of the wild but ', '00:07:51 - 00:07:56: due to its intense he-looking nature it ', '00:07:53 - 00:07:56: quickly became out of the question ', '00:07:56 - 00:08:01: so i looked up on 27 craigslist nearby ', '00:07:59 - 00:08:04: and found a nice little 8a on the back ', '00:08:01 - 00:08:04: side of the boulder ', '00:08:05 - 00:08:08: okay ', \"00:08:06 - 00:08:11: i'm guessing some of you know that i \", \"00:08:08 - 00:08:12: love flashing boulders like it's uh \", '00:08:11 - 00:08:14: whenever i go to something hard or like ', '00:08:12 - 00:08:15: kind of hard i pretty much always try ', '00:08:14 - 00:08:18: and give it a really really proper ', '00:08:15 - 00:08:19: flashburn i figure out all the details ', '00:08:18 - 00:08:20: and everything that makes it possible ', '00:08:19 - 00:08:22: for me ', \"00:08:20 - 00:08:25: and today i'm going to do it with a one \", '00:08:22 - 00:08:28: move a day boulder called the bombis ', '00:08:25 - 00:08:30: explosion i think starting off of ', \"00:08:28 - 00:08:33: this thing right here it's like a \", '00:08:30 - 00:08:35: sloppy two-finger pocket that you kind ', '00:08:33 - 00:08:38: of like you fully crimp it so you get ', '00:08:35 - 00:08:39: something of it there comes like a fake ', '00:08:38 - 00:08:41: four finger hold ', '00:08:39 - 00:08:42: and then you smear ', '00:08:41 - 00:08:43: of ', \"00:08:42 - 00:08:45: somewhere around here here's a pretty \", \"00:08:43 - 00:08:46: big edge but i think it's in the wrong \", \"00:08:45 - 00:08:49: spot and here's \", '00:08:46 - 00:08:51: like a okay smear kind of like a small ', \"00:08:49 - 00:08:52: edge but it's kind of hard to get \", '00:08:51 - 00:08:55: anything of it ', '00:08:52 - 00:08:57: and then you explode up to this jug ', '00:08:55 - 00:08:59: this thing right here ', '00:08:57 - 00:09:01: and this is pretty good ', '00:08:59 - 00:09:03: but i think it can be like hard to hit ', \"00:09:01 - 00:09:06: it right because it's pretty tilted \", '00:09:03 - 00:09:07: see i think you have to hit it like well ', '00:09:06 - 00:09:08: because you want to match it after and ', '00:09:07 - 00:09:10: you want to get it good ', \"00:09:08 - 00:09:13: and then after that it's like \", \"00:09:10 - 00:09:15: i don't know 6 c probably to the top \", \"00:09:13 - 00:09:16: looks very easy i haven't really checked \", '00:09:15 - 00:09:18: it out i think ', \"00:09:16 - 00:09:20: i was told it's a one move wonder so \", \"00:09:18 - 00:09:23: that's we're going to try and flash \", \"00:09:20 - 00:09:23: let's get to it \", '00:09:28 - 00:09:31: okay ', '00:09:36 - 00:09:38: nope ', '00:09:39 -

00:10:30: desperate as [ __ ] ', '00:10:31 - 00:10:34: after these bowlers i thought it was ', '00:10:32 - 00:10:36: time to find a proper project so i ', '00:10:34 - 00:10:39: decided to have a look at the in my eyes ', '00:10:36 - 00:10:40: most proud line in the entire forest ', \"00:10:39 - 00:10:44: it's like \", '00:10:40 - 00:10:44: less than half a pad ', \"00:10:45 - 00:10:49: next up we're on power of now \", '00:10:47 - 00:10:52: an incredible ', '00:10:49 - 00:10:54: [ __ ] crazy bowl that giuliano put up ', '00:10:52 - 00:10:56: two years ago now ', \"00:10:54 - 00:10:58: and it's like this \", '00:10:56 - 00:10:59: how steep do you think this is sam 60 70 ', '00:10:58 - 00:11:00: degrees ', '00:10:59 - 00:11:02: yes ', '00:11:00 - 00:11:04: 60 70 degrees ', '00:11:02 - 00:11:06: where you jump between holes that ', \"00:11:04 - 00:11:07: especially now that i'm here like when i \", '00:11:06 - 00:11:09: stand here looking at them touching them ', \"00:11:07 - 00:11:10: it's kind of crazy that this is \", '00:11:09 - 00:11:12: climbable ', '00:11:10 - 00:11:14: um because you jump so far between them ', '00:11:12 - 00:11:16: like this hole for instance the first ', '00:11:14 - 00:11:19: crux hole that you go to is like a super ', '00:11:16 - 00:11:21: sloppy four finger drag kind of hold ', \"00:11:19 - 00:11:23: with like pretty bad it's the texture is \", \"00:11:21 - 00:11:26: okay but it's like it's far away and \", \"00:11:23 - 00:11:29: it's really quite sloppy \", \"00:11:26 - 00:11:31: uh this crack is pretty good it's like \", '00:11:29 - 00:11:33: half almost a full pad ', '00:11:31 - 00:11:35: you go with up with your heel here and ', '00:11:33 - 00:11:36: like cross over into these holes ', '00:11:35 - 00:11:38: and these are the ones you jump from and ', \"00:11:36 - 00:11:41: they're about \", '00:11:38 - 00:11:43: about half a pad each at most slightly ', '00:11:41 - 00:11:46: less than half a pad and you do like uh ', '00:11:43 - 00:11:48: i think they measured it to 160 ', '00:11:46 - 00:11:50: the move between the holes is 160 ', '00:11:48 - 00:11:52: centimeters ', \"00:11:50 - 00:11:54: so it's like a really big move from \", '00:11:52 - 00:11:57: holds that are just obscene ', '00:11:54 - 00:11:58: obscene to go from ', \"00:11:57 - 00:12:00: we're going to try this a little bit \", '00:11:58 -

00:12:10: i'm really psyched i tried it the other \", '00:12:08 - 00:12:12: day felt ', '00:12:10 - 00:12:14: kind of comfortable on the holes ', '00:12:12 - 00:12:15: but yeah those are the whole some like ', \"00:12:14 - 00:12:17: the upper section we're going to take a \", '00:12:15 - 00:12:19: look at the little ones as well ', '00:12:17 - 00:12:22: so it starts off on this like ', '00:12:19 - 00:12:25: actually non-existent palm press i was ', '00:12:22 - 00:12:26: kind of like is that it when i was on it ', '00:12:25 - 00:12:28: uh ', '00:12:26 - 00:12:31: pressing in do some weird coordination ', '00:12:28 - 00:12:32: into like a ', \"00:12:31 - 00:12:34: it's like a really shitty left hand \", \"00:12:32 -

00:15:13: yeah dude okay one more move to go ', \"00:15:10 - 00:15:15: let's go it's a lot about the left arm \", '00:15:13 - 00:15:16: in that crack because the rhino arm is ', '00:15:15 - 00:15:18: just there to kind of balance you ', '00:15:16 - 00:15:21: then this pushes you ', '00:15:18 - 00:15:21: so you can stay there ', \"00:15:23 - 00:15:25: yeah that's it \", '00:15:35 - 00:15:38: um so the jump move is shredding a ', \"00:15:37 - 00:15:40: little bit too much skin so i'm gonna \", '00:15:38 - 00:15:42: work on the delicate start sequence ', '00:15:40 - 00:15:42: instead ', \"00:15:50 - 00:15:55: yes come on it's good \", '00:15:53 - 00:15:57: there you go come on ', '00:15:55 - 00:15:59: oh yes nice ', '00:15:57 -

00:16:23: much in so i won't be trying the move \", \"00:16:21 - 00:16:25: that's left so much more today i don't \", \"00:16:23 - 00:16:27: think maybe once or twice i'm just gonna \", '00:16:25 - 00:16:29: be working on the upper link ', '00:16:27 - 00:16:30: and uh just gonna focus in on that for a ', \"00:16:29 - 00:16:32: while hopefully i'll make another \", '00:16:30 - 00:16:33: episode on the full line hopefully a ', '00:16:32 - 00:16:35: little bit in daylight and show you guys ', '00:16:33 - 00:16:37: all the moves uh if you want to see that ', '00:16:35 - 00:16:39: let me know in the comments yeah i think ', '00:16:37 - 00:16:42: this is it for ', '00:16:39 - 00:16:44: for today on this boulder ', '00:16:42 - 00:16:46: so that session ended with me working ', '00:16:44 - 00:16:48: the moves a little bit more but i ', '00:16:46 - 00:16:50: decided to come back a little bit later ', '00:16:48 - 00:16:52: however first i wanted to check out two ', '00:16:50 - 00:16:55: bowls that i had tried very briefly on ', '00:16:52 - 00:16:55: my last trip to magic wood ', '00:16:58 - 00:17:02: actually the main goal is to get down to ', '00:16:59 - 00:17:03: power of now and try and unlock it ', '00:17:02 - 00:17:05: because i still have one more move to go ', \"00:17:03 - 00:17:06: but i figured i'd start off by doing \", '00:17:05 - 00:17:08: some recruitment boulders so i was going ', '00:17:06 - 00:17:10: to try and do octopussy here after that ', \"00:17:08 - 00:17:12: i was going to try jack's broken heart \", '00:17:10 - 00:17:13: and then move down to power up now and ', '00:17:12 - 00:17:14: try and finish the last move up and ', '00:17:13 - 00:17:16: maybe ', '00:17:14 - 00:17:20: maybe try to do some proper links on it ', '00:17:16 - 00:17:20: but first octopus ', '00:17:40 - 00:17:48: um ', '00:17:43 - 00:17:48: [Laughter] ', '00:18:06 - 00:18:08: a little ', '00:18:07 - 00:18:10: well a massive ', '00:18:08 - 00:18:12: a massive butt ', '00:18:10 - 00:18:13: with a little dab generally i think ', '00:18:12 - 00:18:15: people should be happy about that type ', \"00:18:13 - 00:18:17: of sand and not let it affect them i'm \", '00:18:15 - 00:18:19: feeling quite energetic and like i can ', \"00:18:17 - 00:18:21: do it again so i'll try and do without \", \"00:18:19 - 00:18:23: the dab but i'm still happy about that \", '00:18:21 - 00:18:25: and it was like basically a sense one ', '00:18:23 - 00:18:27: more go just to make it more kosher and ', '00:18:25 - 00:18:27: clean ', '00:18:31 - 00:18:34: [Music] ', '00:18:38 - 00:18:43: [Music] ', '00:18:47 -

00:19:29: sloper is so clean because you really ', '00:19:28 - 00:19:31: get this like you dig in on the right ', '00:19:29 - 00:19:32: arm when you do it and then you catch ', '00:19:31 - 00:19:33: the sloper like ', \"00:19:32 - 00:19:35: and it just feels good it's a good \", '00:19:33 - 00:19:38: feeling i can recommend this to anybody ', '00:19:35 - 00:19:39: looking to try a really nice a day but ', \"00:19:38 - 00:19:41: we're going to move on to something \", '00:19:39 - 00:19:44: slightly harder now just up it a little ', '00:19:41 - 00:19:44: bit ', '00:19:56 - 00:19:59: [Music] ', \"00:20:08 - 00:20:12: unfortunately jack's broken heart \", '00:20:10 - 00:20:13: quickly came out of the question the ', '00:20:12 - 00:20:15: right heel you had to place proved to be ', '00:20:13 - 00:20:18: too intense for my injured knee and so i ', '00:20:15 - 00:20:21: decided to move down to power of now and ', '00:20:18 - 00:20:23: try to wrap up the final move ', '00:20:21 - 00:20:24: this time it started to click a little ', '00:20:23 - 00:20:26: bit more but all i managed to do was the ', '00:20:24 - 00:20:29: jump start version of the move and so it ', \"00:20:26 - 00:20:30: still remains to be done anyhow that's \", '00:20:29 -

      "[[\"00:00:01 - 00:00:06: In this 3-minute introduction, I'm going to answer four frequently asked questions\", '00:00:06 - 00:00:10: about JavaScript. What is JavaScript, what can you do with', '00:00:10 - 00:00:14: it, where does JavaScript code run and what is the difference between', \"00:00:14 - 00:00:19: JavaScript and ECMAScript. So let's start with the first question. What is\", '00:00:19 - 00:00:24: JavaScript? JavaScript is one of the most popular and widely used programming', \"00:00:24 - 00:00:28: languages in the world right now. It's growing faster than any other\", '00:00:28 - 00:00:34: programming languages and big companies like Netflix, Walmart, and PayPal build', \"00:00:34 - 00:00:38: entire applications around JavaScript. And here's the average salary of a\", '00:00:38 - 00:00:44: JavaScript developer in the United States. That is $72,000 a year. So', \"00:00:44 - 00:00:48: it's a great opportunity to get a good job out of learning JavaScript. You can\", '00:00:48 - 00:00:53: work as a front-end developer or a back-end developer or a full stack', '00:00:53 - 00:00:57: developer who knows both the front end and the back end. Now, the second question.', '00:00:57 - 00:01:01: What can you do with JavaScript? For a long time,', '00:01:01 - 00:01:06: javascript was only used in browsers to build interactive web pages some', '00:01:06 - 00:01:11: developers refer to javascript as a toy language but those days are gone because', '00:01:11 - 00:01:15: of huge community support and investments by large companies like', '00:01:15 - 00:01:20: Facebook and Google these days you can build full-blown web or mobile apps as', '00:01:20 - 00:01:24: well as real time networking applications like chats and video', \"00:01:24 - 00:01:31: streaming services command-line tools or even games here's an example a third\", '00:01:31 - 00:01:36: question where does JavaScript code run javascript was originally designed to', '00:01:36 - 00:01:41: run only in browsers so every browser has what we call a JavaScript engine', '00:01:41 - 00:01:46: that can execute JavaScript code for example the JavaScript engines in', '00:01:46 - 00:01:53: firefox and chrome are SpiderMonkey and v8 in 2009 a very clever engineer called', '00:01:53 - 00:01:59: Ryan Dahl took the open-source JavaScript engine in chrome and embedded', '00:01:59 - 00:02:05: it inside a C++ program he called that program node the node is a C++ program', \"00:02:05 - 00:02:12: that includes Google's v8 JavaScript engine now with this we can run\", '00:02:12 - 00:02:15: JavaScript code out of a browser so we can pass our', '00:02:15 - 00:02:20: JavaScript code to node for execution and this means with JavaScript we can', '00:02:20 - 00:02:26: build the backend for our web and mobile applications so in a nutshell JavaScript', '00:02:26 - 00:02:31: code can be run inside of a browser or in node browsers and node provide a', '00:02:31 - 00:02:37: runtime environment for our JavaScript code and finally the last question what', '00:02:37 - 00:02:42: is the difference between JavaScript and Eggman script well ECMO script is just a', '00:02:42 - 00:02:46: specification javascript is a programming language that confirms to', '00:02:46 - 00:02:51: this specification so we have this organization called a comma which is', '00:02:51 - 00:02:55: responsible for defining standards they take care of this Eggman script', '00:02:55 - 00:03:01: specification the first version of Eggman script was released in 1997 then', '00:03:01 - 00:03:06: starting from 2015 ACMA has been working on annual releases', '00:03:06 - 00:03:12: of a newest specification so in 2015 they released a kimono script 2015 which', '00:03:12 - 00:03:18: is also called ECMO script version 6 or es6 for short this specification defined', '00:03:18 - 00:03:22: many new features for JavaScript alright enough theory', \"00:03:22 - 00:03:27: let's see javascript in action so every browser has a JavaScript engine and we\", '00:03:27 - 00:03:31: can easily write JavaScript code here without any additional tools of course', '00:03:31 - 00:03:35: this is not how we build real-world applications but this is just for a', '00:03:35 - 00:03:42: quick demo so open up Chrome right click on an empty area and go to inspect now', '00:03:42 - 00:03:47: this opens up chrome developer tools here select the console tab this is our', '00:03:47 - 00:03:52: JavaScript console and we can write any valid JavaScript code here so type this', '00:03:52 - 00:04:01: console dot log put a single code here and then hello world another single code', '00:04:01 - 00:04:08: to terminate close the parentheses and add a semicolon at the end now as you go', \"00:04:08 - 00:04:11: through the course you're going to understand exactly what all this means\", \"00:04:11 - 00:04:15: for now don't worry about it so now I'll press ENTER and you can see the hello\", '00:04:15 - 00:04:20: world message on the console we can also write mathematical expressions here for', '00:04:20 - 00:04:26: example two plus two we get four or we can do something like this alert', \"00:04:26 - 00:04:33: practices single coat yo enter and here's an alert in the next lecture I'm\", '00:04:33 - 00:04:37: going to talk about setting up your development environment for writing', '00:04:37 - 00:04:40: JavaScript code ', '00:04:43 - 00:04:48: in order to write javascript code you need a code editor there are various', '00:04:48 - 00:04:53: code editors out there including Visual Studio code or yes code sublime text', '00:04:53 - 00:04:57: atom and so on out of these my favorite is Visual', \"00:04:57 - 00:05:02: Studio code that you can download from code that Visual Studio comm it's a very\", \"00:05:02 - 00:05:07: simple lightweight cross-platform and powerful editor so if you don't have\", '00:05:07 - 00:05:12: Visual Studio code on your machine go ahead and download it the other thing I', '00:05:12 - 00:05:16: wanted to install is note you can download note from nodejs', \"00:05:16 - 00:05:21: org now technically you don't necessarily need know to execute\", '00:05:21 - 00:05:25: JavaScript because as I explained before you can execute JavaScript code inside', \"00:05:25 - 00:05:30: of a browser or EndNote but it's good to have node on your machine because we use\", \"00:05:30 - 00:05:35: that to install third-party libraries and also later in this section I'm going\", '00:05:35 - 00:05:40: to show you a preview of node so pause the video now and download Visual Studio', \"00:05:40 - 00:05:46: code as well as note once you're done come back continue watching\", \"00:05:48 - 00:05:55: to create a new folder call that J s dash basics the name doesn't really\", '00:05:55 - 00:06:00: matter we just want to have a folder for writing all the code in this course now', \"00:06:00 - 00:06:07: drag and drop this folder into visual studio code okay we've got this folder\", \"00:06:07 - 00:06:15: open let's add a new file here index dot HTML now you don't really need to know\", '00:06:15 - 00:06:19: HTML in order to take this course but if you want to be a front-end developer you', '00:06:19 - 00:06:24: should know your HTML well now in this file I want you to type an exclamation', \"00:06:24 - 00:06:30: mark and then press tab this generates some basic HTML boilerplate we don't\", \"00:06:30 - 00:06:34: really care about any of this code here we're gonna use this as a host for our\", \"00:06:34 - 00:06:40: JavaScript code you're gonna see that in the next lecture so save the changes now\", '00:06:40 - 00:06:49: open the extensions tab here here in this box search for live server', \"00:06:49 - 00:06:55: so live server is a very lightweight web server that we're going to use to serve\", '00:06:55 - 00:07:01: our web application so install this then you will have to restart Visual Studio', \"00:07:01 - 00:07:09: code when you're done go to the Explorer tab right click index.html and select\", '00:07:09 - 00:07:13: open with live server ', '00:07:13 - 00:07:18: this will open up Chrome or your default browser and point it to this address', \"00:07:18 - 00:07:23: that's where our web application is served from now currently we have an\", \"00:07:23 - 00:07:27: empty page now to make sure that everything is working properly let's go\", \"00:07:27 - 00:07:34: back to visual studio code here in the body section let's add an h1 press tab\", '00:07:34 - 00:07:41: and type hello world now save the changes back in the browser we can see', \"00:07:41 - 00:07:45: this page is refreshed automatically and we've got the hello world heading here\", \"00:07:45 - 00:07:51: in the next lecture you're going to write your first JavaScript code\", \"00:07:55 - 00:08:00: all right now we're ready to write our first Java Script code in order to write\", '00:08:00 - 00:08:05: JavaScript code here we need a script element there are two places where we', '00:08:05 - 00:08:11: can add a script element we can add it here in a head section or in the body', '00:08:11 - 00:08:17: section the best practice is to put the script element at the end of the body', \"00:08:17 - 00:08:24: section after all the existing elements so here after h1 I'm gonna type script\", '00:08:24 - 00:08:30: and press tab this is our script element now why did I say that as a best', '00:08:30 - 00:08:34: practice you should put this script element here well there are two reasons', '00:08:34 - 00:08:40: for that one reason is that the browser parses this file from top to bottom so', '00:08:40 - 00:08:46: if you put this script element here in the head section you might have a lot of', '00:08:46 - 00:08:51: JavaScript code there so your browser may get busy parsing and executing that', \"00:08:51 - 00:08:57: JavaScript code and it won't be able to render the content of the page so this\", \"00:08:57 - 00:09:01: will create a bad user experience your user looks at your web page it's white\", '00:09:01 - 00:09:06: or blank while your browser is busy parsing and executing your JavaScript', \"00:09:06 - 00:09:12: code so that's reason 1 the second reason is that almost always the code\", '00:09:12 - 00:09:18: that we have in between script elements needs to talk to the elements on this', '00:09:18 - 00:09:23: web page for example we may want to show or hide some elements so by adding the', \"00:09:23 - 00:09:28: code here at the end of the body section we'll be confident that all these\", '00:09:28 - 00:09:33: elements are rendered by the browser now there are exceptions to this rule', \"00:09:33 - 00:09:37: sometimes you're using third-party code that has to be placed in the head\", '00:09:37 - 00:09:42: section but these are exceptions as I told you before as a best practice you', \"00:09:42 - 00:09:47: should add your JavaScript code at the end of the body section now here we're\", '00:09:47 - 00:09:52: gonna write the same code that you wrote in the last lecture console dot log', \"00:09:52 - 00:09:58: hello world but we're going to talk about this in a little bit more detail\", '00:09:58 - 00:10:04: what we have here is a statement a statement is a piece of code that', '00:10:04 - 00:10:09: expresses an action to be carried out in this case we want to log', '00:10:09 - 00:10:15: a message on the console all statements in JavaScript should be terminated by a', '00:10:15 - 00:10:20: semicolon what we have here in between single codes is called', '00:10:20 - 00:10:26: a string a string is a sequence of characters now in JavaScript we also', '00:10:26 - 00:10:34: have this notation we can add two slashes and this represents a comet so', '00:10:34 - 00:10:38: here we can add some description to our code and this description is ignored by', \"00:10:38 - 00:10:43: the JavaScript engine it's not executed it's purely for documenting the code\", '00:10:43 - 00:10:47: when you wanna explain to other developers why you have written this', \"00:10:47 - 00:10:52: code this way you don't explain what the code does because that should be clear\", \"00:10:52 - 00:10:55: in the code itself so here I don't want to write something like logging\", \"00:10:55 - 00:11:00: something on the console that's so obvious in the code right instead we\", \"00:11:00 - 00:11:05: want to explain why's and a house so for this demo I'm just gonna add a simple\", '00:11:05 - 00:11:14: comment this is my first JavaScript code now save the changes back in the browser', '00:11:14 - 00:11:20: we need to bring the console back up so right click somewhere and go to inspect', '00:11:20 - 00:11:27: or alternatively you can use a shortcut that is alt command an eye on Mac or alt', '00:11:27 - 00:11:32: control eye on windows that brings up the console tab if the console tab is', '00:11:32 - 00:11:36: not immediately visible make sure to select it here and here you can see the', '00:11:36 - 00:11:39: hello world message ', '00:11:44 - 00:11:49: now while we can easily write javascript code in between the script element in a', '00:11:49 - 00:11:53: real-world application you have thousands or even millions of code we', \"00:11:53 - 00:11:57: don't want to write all that code in line here we want to extract and\", '00:11:57 - 00:12:02: separate our JavaScript code from our HTML code let me give you a metaphor', \"00:12:02 -

00:12:16: we have the same principle in programming so we want to separate HTML', '00:12:16 - 00:12:20: which is all about content from JavaScript which is all about behavior', '00:12:20 - 00:12:25: how should your web page behave what should happen when we hover our mouse', '00:12:25 -

00:16:23: fundamental concepts in JavaScript and any other programming languages in', \"00:16:23 - 00:16:28: programming we use a variable to store data temporarily in a computer's memory\", '00:16:28 - 00:16:34: so we store our data somewhere and give that memory location and name and with', '00:16:34 - 00:16:38: this name we can read the data at the given location in the future here is a', '00:16:38 - 00:16:43: metaphor think of the boxes you use to organize your stuff you put your stuff', '00:16:43 - 00:16:49: in various boxes and put a label on each box with this you can easily find your', '00:16:49 - 00:16:55: stuff right a variable is like a box what we put inside the box is the value', \"00:16:55 - 00:16:59: that we assign to a variable that's the data and the label that we put on the\", \"00:16:59 - 00:17:05: box is the name of our variable now let's see this in code so here in index\", \"00:17:05 - 00:17:11: Jas I'm gonna declare a variable now previously in the old days before es6 we\", '00:17:11 - 00:17:16: use the VAR keyword to declare a variable but there are issues with var', '00:17:16 - 00:17:22: as you will find out later in the course so going forward from es6 the best', '00:17:22 - 00:17:27: practice is to use the lead keyword to declare a variable now we need to give', '00:17:27 - 00:17:32: this variable a name or an identifier and this is like the label we put on a', \"00:17:32 - 00:17:36: box so I'm gonna call this name and finally we need to terminate this\", \"00:17:36 - 00:17:41: declaration with a semicolon now let's log this on the console and see what we\", '00:17:41 - 00:17:46: get so console that log name once again we', '00:17:46 - 00:17:51: need to terminate this statement with a semicolon save the changes and here in', '00:17:51 - 00:17:56: the console we see undefined so by default variables that we defined in', '00:17:56 - 00:18:01: JavaScript their value is undefined now we can optionally initialize this', \"00:18:01 - 00:18:07: variable so I'm gonna set this to a string which is a sequence of characters\", \"00:18:07 - 00:18:13: like Marsh note that I'm using single quote you can also use double quotes\", \"00:18:13 - 00:18:18: different developers have different preferences but it's more common to use\", '00:18:18 - 00:18:23: single quotes for declaring strings in JavaScript now when we save the changes', '00:18:23 - 00:18:28: instead of one we see Marsh on the console so here in', '00:18:28 - 00:18:32: this example we have declared a variable called name and we have set that to this', '00:18:32 - 00:18:39: value to this string now we have a few rules for naming these variables here', '00:18:39 - 00:18:44: are the rules first is that they cannot be a reserved', '00:18:44 - 00:18:49: keyword so in JavaScript we have reserved keywords let is one of them', \"00:18:49 - 00:18:55: you also have if else VAR and so on now you don't have to memorize this list if\", \"00:18:55 - 00:18:59: you try to use one of these names you're gonna get an error for example if I\", '00:18:59 - 00:19:06: change this to if notice red underline this is indicating that this is not a', '00:19:06 - 00:19:12: valid identifier okay so revert it back now the second rule is that they should', \"00:19:12 - 00:19:18: be meaningful we want to have meaningful names like meaningful labels I've seen\", \"00:19:18 - 00:19:26: developers using names like a or PE or a one or I don't know X these variable\", '00:19:26 - 00:19:30: names do not give us any clue what is the purpose of these variables what kind', '00:19:30 - 00:19:35: of data are restoring at that memory location so always use meaningful and', '00:19:35 - 00:19:44: descriptive names okay now back to name the third rule is that they cannot start', '00:19:44 - 00:19:50: with a number so we cannot have a variable like one name but again going', \"00:19:50 - 00:19:54: back to the second rule why would you want to call it variable one name it's\", '00:19:54 - 00:20:00: meaningless right so always use meaningful names the fourth rule is that', '00:20:00 - 00:20:08: they cannot contain a space or - so if you have multiple words you need to put', \"00:20:08 - 00:20:12: them together here is an example let's imagine we want to declare a variable\", \"00:20:12 - 00:20:20: called first name so first name and note that here I'm using camel notation so\", '00:20:20 - 00:20:25: the first letter of the first word should be lowercase and the first letter', '00:20:25 - 00:20:30: of every word after should be uppercase this is what we call camel notation', '00:20:30 - 00:20:35: which is the convention we use in JavaScript to name our variables another', '00:20:35 - 00:20:38: thing you need to know about these variable names is', '00:20:38 - 00:20:46: they are case-sensitive so if I declare another variable call it first name but', '00:20:46 - 00:20:52: make the F uppercase these two variables are different but as I told you before', \"00:20:52 - 00:20:56: if you stick to camel notation you wouldn't end up with a variable name\", '00:20:56 - 00:21:01: like this and finally the last thing you need to know about these variables is', '00:21:01 - 00:21:06: that if you want to declare multiple variables there are two ways to do this', '00:21:06 - 00:21:11: you can declare them on one line and separate them using a comma so first', '00:21:11 - 00:21:16: name and then last name now in this case I have not initialized either of these', \"00:21:16 - 00:21:21: variables they're both undefined I can optionally initialize one or both of\", '00:21:21 - 00:21:26: them so I can set this to Marsh and I can leave last name undefined or set it', '00:21:26 - 00:21:31: to my last name Hammad on e but the modern best practice is to declare each', '00:21:31 - 00:21:38: variable on a single line so we terminate this first declaration with a', \"00:21:38 - 00:21:42: semicolon and declare the second variable on a new line that's the modern\", \"00:21:42 - 00:21:48: best practice next we're going to look at constants\", \"00:21:53 - 00:21:59: alright now let's declare a variable called interest rate so let interest\", '00:21:59 - 00:22:06: rate and we set this to 0.3 now this is the initial value we can always change', \"00:22:06 - 00:22:12: that later so we can set interest rate to let's say 1 now if you log this on\", \"00:22:12 - 00:22:17: the console of course we're going to see the new value right so save the changes\", \"00:22:17 - 00:22:22: and here's one on the console however in a real-world application there are\", \"00:22:22 - 00:22:27: situations that we don't want the value of a variable to change because\", \"00:22:27 - 00:22:31: otherwise it's going to create all kinds of bugs in our application in those\", '00:22:31 - 00:22:37: situations instead of a variable we use a constant so the value of a variable as', '00:22:37 -

00:37:44: this array on the console so we have an array with three elements', '00:37:44 - 00:37:50: so the length is dynamic it can change also the type of objects we have in this', '00:37:50 - 00:37:55: array is dynamic so unlike other programming languages where every item', '00:37:55 - 00:38:00: or every object in the array should have the same type in JavaScript we can store', '00:38:00 - 00:38:06: different types in an array so we can make the last element a number save the', '00:38:06 - 00:38:12: changes now we have two strings and a number so the objects in the array as', '00:38:12 - 00:38:16: well as the size of the array are dynamic now technically an array is an', '00:38:16 - 00:38:21: object so just like the personal object we defined in the last lecture it has a', '00:38:21 - 00:38:25: bunch of key value pairs or properties that we can access using the dot', \"00:38:25 - 00:38:29: notation let me prove that to you so here on the console let's look at the\", '00:38:29 - 00:38:37: type of selected colors so the type of this array is an object so an array is', '00:38:37 - 00:38:43: an object in JavaScript so here on line 4 we can look at the properties of this', '00:38:43 - 00:38:48: array or this object using the dot notation look these are all the', '00:38:48 - 00:38:53: properties defined in arrays in JavaScript so every time we declare an', '00:38:53 - 00:38:58: array using square brackets that array will automatically receive these', \"00:38:58 - 00:39:03: properties we didn't explicitly define them they're just somehow magically\", \"00:39:03 - 00:39:07: inherited from somewhere else we're going to learn about that later when we\", \"00:39:07 -

00:39:26: three elements in this array now later in the course we have a comprehensive', \"00:39:26 - 00:39:30: section about arrays you'll learn about all kinds of operations we can perform\", '00:39:30 - 00:39:36: on arrays for now all I want you to take away is that an array is a data', '00:39:36 - 00:39:41: structure that we use to represent a list of items', '00:39:46 - 00:39:51: in the category of reference types you have learned about objects and arrays', \"00:39:51 - 00:39:56: now let's take a look at functions functions are one of the fundamental\", '00:39:56 - 00:40:01: building blocks in JavaScript a function is basically a set of statements that', '00:40:01 - 00:40:07: performs a task or calculates a value let me show you a couple of examples so', \"00:40:07 - 00:40:11: I'm going to declare a function using the function keyword now we need to give\", \"00:40:11 - 00:40:17: it a name let's call that greet after that we need to add parentheses that's\", '00:40:17 - 00:40:22: part of the syntax for declaring functions and then curly braces now what', '00:40:22 - 00:40:28: we have here inside the curly braces is what we refer to as the body of this', '00:40:28 - 00:40:32: function and this is where we add all these statements to define some kind of', '00:40:32 - 00:40:38: logic in our application for example the logic for this function should be to', '00:40:38 - 00:40:47: display a message on the console so here we can add console the log hello world', '00:40:47 - 00:40:53: now note that here we have a statement so we terminated with a semicolon but', \"00:40:53 - 00:40:57: when we are declaring a function we don't need to add semicolon at the end\", '00:40:57 - 00:41:03: because we are not declaring it like a variable like this okay this is a', '00:41:03 - 00:41:09: function declaration right so now we have a function we can call this', '00:41:09 - 00:41:14: function like this so we add the name of the function and parentheses again and', '00:41:14 - 00:41:21: then semicolon to indicate that this is a statement save the changes now we have', \"00:41:21 - 00:41:25: hello world on the console but that's pretty boring what would we do this let\", '00:41:25 - 00:41:28: me show you how to make this more interesting our functions can have', \"00:41:28 - 00:41:35: inputs and these inputs can change how the function behaves so let's say\", '00:41:35 - 00:41:39: instead of displaying hello world we want to display the name of the person', '00:41:39 - 00:41:48: here like hello John so we can add a variable here in between parentheses we', '00:41:48 - 00:41:53: refer to this variable as a parameter so this greet function has one parameter', '00:41:53 - 00:41:59: called name and essentially name is like a variable that is only meaningful', '00:41:59 - 00:42:02: inside dysfunction so inside of this function', '00:42:02 - 00:42:07: we can work with this name variable but it will not be accessible outside of', '00:42:07 - 00:42:12: this function the name is an input to this function so instead of displaying', '00:42:12 - 00:42:18: hello world we can display hello then add a plus here to concatenate two', '00:42:18 - 00:42:26: strings so we can add name after now when calling the great function we need', '00:42:26 - 00:42:32: to pass a value for the name variable or name parameter more accurately so we can', '00:42:32 - 00:42:40: pass John here now we refer to this as an argument so John is an argument to', \"00:42:40 - 00:42:46: the greet function a name is a parameter of the greet function it's one of the\", \"00:42:46 - 00:42:49: things that a lot of programmers don't know they don't know the difference\", '00:42:49 - 00:42:54: between a parameter and an argument so a parameter is what we have here at the', '00:42:54 - 00:43:00: time of declaration but the argument is the actual value with supply for that', \"00:43:00 - 00:43:04: parameter okay now let's save the changes so we have\", '00:43:04 - 00:43:10: hello John now we can reuse this function but with a different input so', '00:43:10 - 00:43:17: we can copy this line here and change on to Mary save the changes now we have two', '00:43:17 - 00:43:23: different messages on the console now a function can have multiple parameters so', \"00:43:23 - 00:43:28: here we can separate parameters using a comma so let's add another parameter\", '00:43:28 - 00:43:36: like last name now we can change our console not blog add a space here and', '00:43:36 - 00:43:43: then display the last name now when calling this great function we', \"00:43:43 - 00:43:46: should pass another argument for the last name right but let's see what\", \"00:43:46 -
