00:04:47 - 00:04:51: [Music]
00:04:49 - 00:04:54: he's definitely he's lost his freedom
00:04:51 - 00:04:56: before bro I used my mom used my mom
00:04:54 - 00:04:57: would actually physically get mad at me
00:04:56 - 00:04:59: the way I would take naps I swear to God
00:04:57 - 00:05:01: I would take naps like this
00:04:59 - 00:05:03: like you're dead I was dead I would
00:05:01 - 00:05:05: literally go like this or like this and
00:05:03 - 00:05:07: she would wait she'd get home from work
00:05:05 - 00:05:08: and I'd just be asleep on the couch like
00:05:07 - 00:05:10: this
00:05:08 - 00:05:12: you're like please stop going to bed
00:05:10 - 00:05:13: like that yeah it's a bad visual no no
00:05:12 - 00:05:16: one likes that it literally it's like
00:05:13 - 00:05:18: I'm in a casket but I I get that uh
00:05:16 - 00:05:20: prison though if you sleep like this bro
00:05:18 - 00:05:21: definitely the opening scenes like a
00:05:20 - 00:05:24: Netflix original that's about jail like
00:05:21 - 00:05:25: if a guy's like this in his prison bed
00:05:24 - 00:05:27: and he's about to fight in himself like
00:05:25 - 00:05:29: for some soap or something that he
00:05:27 - 00:05:32: doesn't need to drop but anyway
00:05:29 - 00:05:35: um yeah we're getting more PG-13 on here
00:05:32 - 00:05:37: no speaking of PG-13 no I just I have a

00:05:42 - 00:05:45: white people are like green and they're
00:05:43 - 00:05:48: like yellow and they don't look good and
00:05:45 - 00:05:50: y'all age like bananas what we age like
00:05:48 - 00:05:53: bananas
00:05:50 - 00:05:55: that's kind of accurate because when a
00:05:53 - 00:05:59: banana and they get like those brown
00:05:55 - 00:06:02: spots and white people do get them
00:05:59 - 00:06:05: bro we look like tortillas when we're

00:08:12 - 00:08:17: I'm not thinking about that stuff I am
00:08:15 - 00:08:19: whenever you're doing it I think look at
00:08:17 - 00:08:22: the [ __ ] on that clip I think certain
00:08:19 - 00:08:24: things get passed down like what you eat
00:08:22 - 00:08:27: and what you drink oh a million because
00:08:24 - 00:08:30: my dad always had sugar-free Red Bull
00:08:27 - 00:08:32: and Diet Coke every day God that's why
00:08:30 - 00:08:34: you're the one so I'm that way and
00:08:32 - 00:08:36: that's why you're the way you are and he
00:08:34 - 00:08:38: would always have Crown Royal like when
00:08:36 - 00:08:40: he would drink it was crown
00:08:38 - 00:08:42: I remember once a good man you know me
00:08:40 - 00:08:44: and my crown legally this is a joke and
00:08:42 - 00:08:46: this is for satire one time I walked
00:08:44 - 00:08:48: into my parents bedroom and my dad had
00:08:46 - 00:08:51: his crown glass it was just looked like
00:08:48 - 00:08:53: a brown you know like a
00:08:51 - 00:08:55: like a clear glass with brown in it yeah
00:08:53 - 00:08:56: and I was feeding for Diet Coke and so I
00:08:55 - 00:08:58: ran into the room as a kid probably
00:08:56 - 00:09:01: didn't have no pants on
00:08:58 - 00:09:01: mom and dad
00:09:02 - 00:09:06: hit my tail
00:09:04 - 00:09:10: and I walked in and I saw the diet coke
00:09:06 - 00:09:11: it wasn't Diet Coke I saw the the what
00:09:10 - 00:09:15: it was is a crown glass and I said oh
00:09:11 - 00:09:15: Diet Coke and I said
00:09:17 - 00:09:24: like your throat is on fire bro dude

00:12:47 - 00:12:51: five golf carts with a grown man and I

00:19:37 - 00:19:40: spell on you bro
00:19:38 - 00:19:43: someone have to pull up in an identical
00:19:40 - 00:19:46: Jeep not me you maybe you okay a more
00:19:43 - 00:19:49: rational fear a more rational fear is

00:19:58 - 00:20:03: hope she's still alive but
00:20:00 - 00:20:04: um sorry uh a more rational fear is
00:20:03 - 00:20:06: getting in your car after leaving
00:20:04 - 00:20:09: somewhere and there's someone in the car
00:20:06 - 00:20:09: Drive

00:20:38 - 00:20:42: straight to a wall bro if someone again
00:20:40 - 00:20:43: if Machinery is involved that's
00:20:42 - 00:20:45: different because at any moment they can
00:20:43 - 00:20:47: end me no if they just get a wire and
00:20:45 - 00:20:49: they're giving me a slight choke almost
00:20:47 - 00:20:51: to where you like it but a slight just a
00:20:49 - 00:20:53: just just enough to where it's not
00:20:51 - 00:20:54: freaky as well just enough to where you
00:20:53 - 00:20:56: don't it's not enjoyable but they're
00:20:54 - 00:20:58: really taking the air out of you and
00:20:56 - 00:21:00: they're like drive here take this left I
00:20:58 - 00:21:02: would slam us right into a wall like I
00:21:00 - 00:21:03: would literally I'd slap another car I
00:21:02 - 00:21:06: would slam into another car and hope to
00:21:03 - 00:21:08: God I don't like injure them there's no
00:21:06 - 00:21:10: there's no way I listen to your
00:21:08 - 00:21:12: instructions like this is Simon says
00:21:10 - 00:21:14: when I'm being interrogated held hostage
00:21:12 - 00:21:17: yeah and I'm just gonna go where to next

00:41:06 - 00:41:10: you might piss me okay our childhoods
00:41:09 - 00:41:12: were different but I was at least
00:41:10 - 00:41:15: reasonable you were and you were living
00:41:12 - 00:41:17: in damn Fairyland oh my God okay when
00:41:15 - 00:41:19: you first found out
00:41:17 - 00:41:21: about colored TVs right whenever your
00:41:19 - 00:41:23: parents would be like Hey whenever I was
00:41:21 - 00:41:25: a kid we didn't have colored TVs
00:41:23 - 00:41:27: everything was black and white okay did
00:41:25 - 00:41:29: you ever think like I used to think
00:41:27 - 00:41:31: whenever the TVs were black and white
00:41:29 - 00:41:34: did you ever think the whole world was
00:41:31 - 00:41:37: black and white back then
00:41:34 - 00:41:39: no I could not be the only one you
00:41:37 - 00:41:41: you just asked me if I thought Earth was
00:41:39 - 00:41:44: black and white I thought so too
00:41:41 - 00:41:45: I did not think that that's stupid no
00:41:44 - 00:41:47: and I asked my dad I was like so
00:41:45 - 00:41:49: whenever you're like when did you first
00:41:47 - 00:41:51: get color
00:41:49 - 00:41:53: like what was the day whenever you with
00:41:51 - 00:41:55: the grass was green and so one day you
00:41:53 - 00:41:58: didn't just go like this oh [ __ ] I have
00:41:55 - 00:42:00: red shorts on no but when I was born we
00:41:58 - 00:42:03: had color TVs you think color was
00:42:00 - 00:42:06: invented in like the 50s I thought so I
00:42:03 - 00:42:09: thought so all of color maybe you didn't
00:42:06 - 00:42:11: think that not for a not for a literal
00:42:09 - 00:42:13: second of my life okay but I was
00:42:11 - 00:42:15: thinking it doesn't make sense why is
00:42:13 - 00:42:18: the TVs black and white then
00:42:15 - 00:42:20: if the world isn't black and white so I
00:42:18 - 00:42:23: thought one day like somebody created it
00:42:20 - 00:42:24: color I cannot be the only person who
00:42:23 - 00:42:27: thought this was so you thought one day
00:42:24 - 00:42:30: Van Gogh was just sitting there like hmm
00:42:27 - 00:42:33: color I don't know how it happened maybe
00:42:30 - 00:42:35: technology I don't know that's so bad
00:42:33 - 00:42:36: that is idiocracy no a lot of people
00:42:35 - 00:42:38: have thought this I can guarantee it I
00:42:36 - 00:42:39: can't be the only person who stopped
00:42:38 - 00:42:40: this I hope to God y'all didn't think
00:42:39 - 00:42:42: that
00:42:40 - 00:42:42: that's a good thought
00:42:43 - 00:42:50: white Earth yeah maybe nobody no nobody
00:42:47 - 00:42:53: never I it's a serious conversation I
00:42:50 - 00:42:55: have my dad that's so damn I hope your
00:42:53 - 00:42:57: dad just smacked your neck it is stupid

00:43:03 - 00:43:07: no way there's no way that's so bad like

00:50:13 - 00:50:18: ask so you're saying
00:50:16 - 00:50:21: you're saying for Fruit Loops they don't
00:50:18 - 00:50:24: use them you look like a pitbull
00:50:21 - 00:50:27: so you're saying
00:50:24 - 00:50:28: so you're saying that for Fruit Loops
00:50:27 - 00:50:30: they don't take actual fruits and and

00:50:30 - 00:50:33: that correct
00:50:32 - 00:50:34: but you're saying they do that for
00:50:33 - 00:50:37: Gatorade that's why they're different
00:50:34 - 00:50:39: flavors incorrect

00:53:07 - 00:53:10: so this is what happened inside the mega
00:53:09 - 00:53:13: gallery
00:53:10 - 00:53:16: I hate people like you dog it's like my
00:53:13 - 00:53:16: biggest like pet beef
00:53:16 - 00:53:20: so
00:53:18 - 00:53:22: they get dressed up they go into this
00:53:20 - 00:53:23: thing and it's basically like this big
00:53:22 - 00:53:25: ballroom and there's tables of the most
00:53:23 - 00:53:27: important powerful rich people famous
00:53:25 - 00:53:29: people in the world and it's basically
00:53:27 - 00:53:31: just like a networking thing you're like
00:53:29 - 00:53:34: Hey we're Super Famous and we're Super
00:53:31 - 00:53:36: Rich what do you do how can I get that
00:53:34 - 00:53:37: to come to my thing and basically that's
00:53:36 - 00:53:38: how it works so it's like hey let's take
00:53:37 - 00:53:39: Instagram pictures and then they do
00:53:38 - 00:53:42: drugs in the bathroom that's what
00:53:39 - 00:53:44: happens and then the food I heard is bad
00:53:42 - 00:53:47: now I would love to go to the Met Gala
00:53:44 - 00:53:48: I would wear some cool [ __ ] like I would
00:53:47 - 00:53:50: wear like a thong to the mega I'd wear a
00:53:48 - 00:53:51: plain white tee a plain white Hanes
00:53:50 - 00:53:53: you're not that you have to be super
00:53:51 - 00:53:55: famous to do that plain white Haines
00:53:53 - 00:53:56: till I make it plain white you're not
00:53:55 - 00:53:59: you're not wearing plain white hands now
00:53:56 - 00:54:00: plain white hands I'd make it but
00:53:59 - 00:54:02: um
00:54:00 - 00:54:04: I would literally send a message back
00:54:02 - 00:54:06: and decline it you know how much a table
00:54:04 - 00:54:10: at the Met Gala cost I'm gonna go with
00:54:06 - 00:54:11: 200 000 around 250 to 300 000 but these
00:54:10 - 00:54:13: people the famous people aren't paying
00:54:11 - 00:54:15: for it basically like these designers
00:54:13 - 00:54:17: yeah that are putting these clothes on
00:54:15 - 00:54:19: people are paying for the tables or
00:54:17 - 00:54:21: whatever yeah and uh what's her name

00:54:24 - 00:54:27: together
00:54:25 - 00:54:30: um it's a very like classy not classy
00:54:27 - 00:54:32: but like a class not classist uh it's
00:54:30 - 00:54:34: based on the classes you know like the
00:54:32 - 00:54:36: top people go like the kingdom order and
00:54:34 - 00:54:39: phylum yeah I think it's cool King

00:55:02 - 00:55:06: recordings in there
00:55:04 - 00:55:07: there's definitely if you have these
00:55:06 - 00:55:09: basically if you don't listen if you
00:55:07 - 00:55:11: have these celebrities they're close no

00:55:21 - 00:55:24: I'll be hopefully you know taught
00:55:22 - 00:55:25: something so apparently they do the
00:55:24 - 00:55:27: entire ball they're at the whole event
00:55:25 - 00:55:29: they see everyone they walk the carpet
00:55:27 - 00:55:31: they sit at the tables afterwards
00:55:29 - 00:55:34: there's an exclusive dinner
00:55:31 - 00:55:35: huge right where everyone's still in
00:55:34 - 00:55:37: their costumes and whatnot that's
00:55:35 - 00:55:38: apparently where people take off their
00:55:37 - 00:55:40: costumes not get naked and on some weird
00:55:38 - 00:55:41: stuff but like they're just more you can
00:55:40 - 00:55:42: actually move around yeah we can
00:55:41 - 00:55:43: actually move like what's his face is
00:55:42 - 00:55:46: wearing a big ass cat thing that's
00:55:43 - 00:55:48: creepy but you know that it's for the
00:55:46 - 00:55:49: theme yeah yeah the theme was after this
00:55:48 - 00:55:51: designer and his designer took that cat
00:55:49 - 00:55:53: everywhere oh gosh there you go uh
00:55:51 - 00:55:54: anyway Apparently after they take off
00:55:53 - 00:55:56: their normal clothing and they go to
00:55:54 - 00:56:00: this really big very rich wealthy
00:55:56 - 00:56:04: expensive only the elitists dinner
00:56:00 - 00:56:04: no one else is allowed
00:56:04 - 00:56:08: that's all I'm saying so no one was
00:56:07 - 00:56:11: allowed into r
00:56:08 - 00:56:14: party that we had here right correct are
00:56:11 - 00:56:15: we Elite incorrect no like Outsiders
00:56:14 - 00:56:16: right
00:56:15 - 00:56:18: the people that were invited could come
00:56:16 - 00:56:20: I'm just saying
00:56:18 - 00:56:22: whenever we have events only the people
00:56:20 - 00:56:24: that we invite can come right correct
00:56:22 - 00:56:26: all right does that make us
00:56:24 - 00:56:28: super like oh we got some shady [ __ ]
00:56:26 - 00:56:30: going on no but do we have any
00:56:28 - 00:56:32: circulating rumors and conspiracies
00:56:30 - 00:56:33: about us no because we're not famous
00:56:32 - 00:56:36: enough
00:56:33 - 00:56:38: yes we already have people say I sold my
00:56:36 - 00:56:40: soul don't say it no I'm gonna say it
00:56:38 - 00:56:42: the people say I sold my soul yeah it's
00:56:40 - 00:56:44: ridiculous and that's how we got our
00:56:42 - 00:56:46: Fame that's insane
00:56:44 - 00:56:49: yeah it's like once you get to it people
00:56:46 - 00:56:51: can't fathom like success or like once
00:56:49 - 00:56:52: you get to a certain thing like oh that
00:56:51 - 00:56:53: can't be like hard work or it can't be
00:56:52 - 00:56:55: even nepotism it can't be the idea
00:56:53 - 00:56:56: because if you have sold your soul and
00:56:55 - 00:56:58: this whole thing you can't record in
00:56:56 - 00:56:59: there if you have these celebrities on
00:56:58 - 00:57:00: your on if you're in their close friends
00:56:59 - 00:57:01: with some of them that were at the
00:57:00 - 00:57:04: medical I mean they're close friends on
00:57:01 - 00:57:06: Instagram tuned my own horn but I'm just
00:57:04 - 00:57:07: saying to give Insight they record in
00:57:06 - 00:57:09: there and they just put on their close
00:57:07 - 00:57:11: friends no no I'm also Playing devil's
00:57:09 - 00:57:14: advocate but
00:57:11 - 00:57:17: I don't know I I'm I'm on both sides yes
00:57:14 - 00:57:18: do I believe a lot of that is people
00:57:17 - 00:57:19: with way too much time on their hands
00:57:18 - 00:57:21: and definitely have done a little
00:57:19 - 00:57:23: something before they research yes do I
00:57:21 - 00:57:26: also believe there's definitely some
00:57:23 - 00:57:27: crazy evil things at work yes there's
00:57:26 - 00:57:29: that's everywhere though I agree it's
00:57:27 - 00:57:31: everywhere I don't but the thing I don't
00:57:29 - 00:57:32: like is I hate how everything now is a
00:57:31 - 00:57:34: conspiracy like I hate when there's
00:57:32 - 00:57:36: award shows immediately it's like oh
00:57:34 - 00:57:38: look at that look at they moved their
00:57:36 - 00:57:40: arm this way and that's what that like
00:57:38 - 00:57:42: that [ __ ] pisses me off and now the
00:57:40 - 00:57:44: whole Will Smith slap huge conspiracy
00:57:42 - 00:57:45: hate that huge conspiracy it's just a
00:57:44 - 00:57:48: dude that got mad and slapped somebody
00:57:45 - 00:57:50: apparently he went up there slapped him
00:57:48 - 00:57:52: medical company was a specific one was
00:57:50 - 00:57:53: the one that sponsored the show tons of
00:57:52 - 00:57:55: people drew into them and it took away
00:57:53 - 00:57:57: from something they were actually doing
00:57:55 - 00:57:59: on the backside that had to do with
00:57:57 - 00:58:00: whatnot and there's literally
00:57:59 - 00:58:02: conspiracies about everything I do hate
00:58:00 - 00:58:04: that but some of them are pretty like
00:58:02 - 00:58:06: yeah because oh wow yeah if you're a
00:58:04 - 00:58:08: good enough Storyteller you take enough
00:58:06 - 00:58:09: drugs you can wait you can your mind can
00:58:08 - 00:58:11: go anywhere and you can make these
00:58:09 - 00:58:12: things out of everything but let me tell
00:58:11 - 00:58:13: you another thing because this is what I
00:58:12 - 00:58:15: like to do I'm like
00:58:13 - 00:58:17: now that I'm in a position where I'm
00:58:15 - 00:58:18: learning more things and I'm more into
00:58:17 - 00:58:20: the industry and I know more people I
00:58:18 - 00:58:21: have more insight and I'm not going to
00:58:20 - 00:58:22: be one of those people like oh I'm gonna
00:58:21 - 00:58:24: hide it from I'm gonna tell y'all how
00:58:22 - 00:58:27: [ __ ] works so
00:58:24 - 00:58:29: these these musicians and these record
00:58:27 - 00:58:31: labels they know that these conspiracies
00:58:29 - 00:58:33: are going to come out if they do a
00:58:31 - 00:58:36: performance right
00:58:33 - 00:58:37: any you know like the the uh the famous
00:58:36 - 00:58:39: saying is any publicity is good
00:58:37 - 00:58:41: publicity
00:58:39 - 00:58:43: so they're like we know people are going
00:58:41 - 00:58:45: to make conspiracies about it let's make
00:58:43 - 00:58:46: some [ __ ] where we can sprinkle in
00:58:45 - 00:58:48: something where it's like make this arm
00:58:46 - 00:58:49: movement and people are going to say
00:58:48 - 00:58:51: it's a conspiracy and then they're gonna
00:58:49 - 00:58:53: clip that and clip that performance and
00:58:51 - 00:58:54: put it everywhere now that performance
00:58:53 - 00:58:56: with your song that we need to get
00:58:54 - 00:58:58: engagement is going to be on this side
00:58:56 - 00:59:00: this side this side and if they want to
00:58:58 - 00:59:02: use it they have to pay us to use it in
00:59:00 - 00:59:04: their video genius so a lot of this [ __ ]
00:59:02 - 00:59:06: is planted so you're funny
00:59:04 - 00:59:07: you can make these conspiracy videos
00:59:06 - 00:59:09: about it okay another thing and
00:59:07 - 00:59:10: obviously like I already told you I was
00:59:09 - 00:59:11: playing Devil's Advocate but another
00:59:10 - 00:59:12: thing that irks me is when they're like
00:59:11 - 00:59:15: dude then why don't they allow recording
00:59:12 - 00:59:17: stuff it's like bro like I'm sure LeBron
00:59:15 - 00:59:18: doesn't want to be recorded when he's
00:59:17 - 00:59:20: having eight to nine drinks as he
00:59:18 - 00:59:22: rightfully can and wants to exactly
00:59:20 - 00:59:24: because then anything could be held
00:59:22 - 00:59:26: above his head like you don't understand
00:59:24 - 00:59:29: these people are worth millions and some
00:59:26 - 00:59:31: billions of dollars they deserve to like
00:59:29 - 00:59:33: they can't go to an Applebee's they have
00:59:31 - 00:59:35: to have these crazy things so they
00:59:33 - 00:59:36: deserve you know to have fun too it's
00:59:35 - 00:59:38: like like the other day I saw a video on
00:59:36 - 00:59:40: Twitter Zendaya and Tom Holland eating
00:59:38 - 00:59:42: at a restaurant and there's like people

00:59:42 - 00:59:46: yeah so yeah no recording no phones and
00:59:45 - 00:59:49: we want to have a good time with that
00:59:46 - 00:59:51: regular people can go to a party get
00:59:49 - 00:59:53: blasted fall out on a couch and you can
00:59:51 - 00:59:55: record it and put it on your lap in like
