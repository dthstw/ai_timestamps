00:01:58 - 00:02:01: tree Nicholas I haven't played Earth
00:02:00 - 00:02:04: tree yet we're still playing oh yeah
00:02:01 - 00:02:06: you're um but uh I enjoy it because I
00:02:04 - 00:02:09: enjoy playing with Mike and Andy I think
00:02:06 - 00:02:10: the scene with Co mod this is a mod SE
00:02:09 - 00:02:12: Co-op mod put out by I forget the
00:02:10 - 00:02:13: company I'd love to shout him out maybe
00:02:12 - 00:02:16: someone in the live chat shout him out
00:02:13 - 00:02:17: right now probably Game Genie um so much
00:02:16 - 00:02:18: so I think people are enjoying it so
00:02:17 - 00:02:20: much that if I'm not mistaken the
00:02:18 - 00:02:22: creator of uh of Elden ring was like Hey
00:02:20 - 00:02:24: I see it like we see that you you guys
00:02:22 - 00:02:27: like this so maybe we'll do a seamless
00:02:24 - 00:02:28: Co-op mod for the game at some point
00:02:27 - 00:02:29: later down the road I'm like that would
00:02:28 - 00:02:31: be so rad because it's really fun and
00:02:29 - 00:02:33: it's you know it's a mod so it's every
00:02:31 - 00:02:35: once in a while you just can't see the
00:02:33 - 00:02:36: bad guy that's killing you or whatever
00:02:35 - 00:02:38: but you know for for all intents and
00:02:36 - 00:02:40: purposes it's some of the most fun we've
00:02:38 - 00:02:42: had streaming period but again back to
00:02:40 - 00:02:45: it I this I would traditionally think a
00:02:42 - 00:02:48: Souls light game not your cup of tea it
00:02:45 - 00:02:50: is not my cup of tea but I'm it's fun to
00:02:48 - 00:02:51: play with Mike and Andy because I think
00:02:50 - 00:02:53: you get a little it's a different
00:02:51 - 00:02:55: Dynamic so when I went to play Dark
00:02:53 - 00:02:58: Souls for the first time with Mike I was
00:02:55 - 00:03:00: like I don't understand why people enjoy
00:02:58 - 00:03:01: this I don't understand why people want
00:03:00 - 00:03:03: this experience in their lives the game
00:03:01 - 00:03:04: is I mean you can hear you guys can go
00:03:03 - 00:03:07: back and watch I'm like this game is
00:03:04 - 00:03:09: willfully obtuse this game is just hard
00:03:07 - 00:03:12: for no reason it is it is the mechanics
00:03:09 - 00:03:14: are basically fundamentally broken in
00:03:12 - 00:03:15: that game uh and I don't understand why
00:03:14 - 00:03:17: people crave this experience and then
00:03:15 - 00:03:19: you cut to like 15 minutes ago when I
00:03:17 - 00:03:20: got out of the lab and I'm smiling I
00:03:19 - 00:03:22: have time dud you guys are screaming in
00:03:20 - 00:03:23: there today we're having I mean we spent
00:03:22 - 00:03:25: an hour and a half trying to beat one
00:03:23 - 00:03:27: boss and didn't beat him and it's some
00:03:25 - 00:03:29: of the most fun I've had playing with
00:03:27 - 00:03:31: the boys in a while so it's fun I just I
00:03:29 - 00:03:33: will never okay I'll never play a game
00:03:31 - 00:03:34: by I'll never play that game by myself
00:03:33 - 00:03:36: forget it it's just I don't need that I
00:03:34 - 00:03:38: don't need that smoke in my life do you
00:03:36 - 00:03:40: stop and think about it you know us
00:03:38 - 00:03:43: three it's been quite the journey these
00:03:40 - 00:03:44: past 10 years uh obviously more than
00:03:43 - 00:03:47: that 2012 when I started doing the
00:03:44 - 00:03:49: [ __ ] Oro show and the cin show do you
00:03:47 - 00:03:51: think ever stop and think about like
00:03:49 - 00:03:52: your Evolution as a gamer throughout it
00:03:51 - 00:03:55: cuz it's not that you didn't play games
00:03:52 - 00:03:58: before but you definitely were the least
00:03:55 - 00:03:59: gamer of all of us it's funny cuz people
00:03:58 - 00:04:00: ask me outside they go what do you do
00:03:59 - 00:04:02: and I go well do this this this and
00:04:00 - 00:04:03: twitch stream they go oh so you play a
00:04:02 - 00:04:05: lot of games and I go no I never play
00:04:03 - 00:04:06: games and then every time I do that I
00:04:05 - 00:04:09: stop and think oh I play games three
00:04:06 - 00:04:12: hours a day different games like my the
00:04:09 - 00:04:15: I I don't I'm kind of a I mean I have I
00:04:12 - 00:04:16: have a good knowledge of a wide breath
00:04:15 - 00:04:18: of games but I'm a master of none of
00:04:16 - 00:04:19: them sure like with the rare I wouldn't
00:04:18 - 00:04:22: say I'm a master but with the exception
00:04:19 - 00:04:23: of like rebirth Call of Duty ranked
00:04:22 - 00:04:26: which we've been playing a lot which I
00:04:23 - 00:04:28: actually are I'm now like so deep down
00:04:26 - 00:04:29: that rabbit hole that I'm I'm competent
00:04:28 - 00:04:31: enough but I'm so deep down the rabbit
00:04:29 - 00:04:34: hole that I'm following like Cod
00:04:31 - 00:04:35: Community oh my God to get that metal
00:04:34 - 00:04:37: load out it's pretty incredible to the
00:04:35 - 00:04:39: point where I was like I I I downloaded
00:04:37 - 00:04:40: an app and I was reading about which app
00:04:39 - 00:04:42: to get on Reddit and someone was like
00:04:40 - 00:04:43: you got to pay for this app I'm not
00:04:42 - 00:04:45: paying for that garbage you're paying
00:04:43 - 00:04:46: for that [ __ ] app so I might I might
00:04:45 - 00:04:49: see what happens we'll see what happens
00:04:46 - 00:04:51: but it's nice to do that um and I think
00:04:49 - 00:04:53: one of the reasons why I I I can see why
00:04:51 - 00:04:55: people like Elden ring is because I feel
00:04:53 - 00:04:56: like so many experiences in gaming are
00:04:55 - 00:04:58: just like I feel like I'm wasting time
00:04:56 - 00:04:59: I'm not investing in this and Elder ring
00:04:58 - 00:05:01: is one of those games like Call of Duty
00:04:59 - 00:05:02: where I feel like you can get better and
00:05:01 - 00:05:04: better and better at it similar to every
00:05:02 - 00:05:05: game really if you think about it but
00:05:04 - 00:05:07: one of the reasons I love Cod is cuz I'm
00:05:05 - 00:05:09: like it's new every single time I jump
00:05:07 - 00:05:11: in and I feel myself getting better for
00:05:09 - 00:05:13: instance me Mike and Chris Anka have
00:05:11 - 00:05:14: been playing ranked every night I don't
00:05:13 - 00:05:16: think Chris is gonna play with us
00:05:14 - 00:05:18: anymore you so bad the other night he
00:05:16 - 00:05:20: just he Al up forward and just hasn't
00:05:18 - 00:05:21: talked to me since we might send him
00:05:20 - 00:05:23: flowers we'll put it that way what did
00:05:21 - 00:05:25: you do I went through the door and I was
00:05:23 - 00:05:26: supposed to go through the door Greg you
00:05:25 - 00:05:29: you can't go through the
00:05:26 - 00:05:31: window we dropped we dropped chem
00:05:29 - 00:05:32: engineering that our normal rotation and
00:05:31 - 00:05:34: the idea is we always have to hold down
00:05:32 - 00:05:36: this like this patio area that we're on
00:05:34 - 00:05:38: top of yeah and then if there's another
00:05:36 - 00:05:40: team we push together and I got a little
00:05:38 - 00:05:43: excited yeah and I pushed through and
00:05:40 - 00:05:45: Mike saw me and was like I'll go too and
00:05:43 - 00:05:47: Chris is like screaming at us like don't
00:05:45 - 00:05:48: go through the wind don't go through the
00:05:47 - 00:05:49: door don't go through the window and I
00:05:48 - 00:05:51: went and I just clashed with three dudes
00:05:49 - 00:05:54: and they iced me and Mike and then just
00:05:51 - 00:05:55: hunted Chris down and I and Mike's like
00:05:54 - 00:05:56: he waited the perfect amount of time and
00:05:55 - 00:05:58: he
00:05:56 - 00:05:59: goes do you guys want to play and and
00:05:58 - 00:06:02: Chris goes nope and then left the
00:05:59 - 00:06:03: Discord just gone like gone and I
00:06:02 - 00:06:05: haven't talked to that was 3 days ago I
00:06:03 - 00:06:07: haven't talked toing so I think I got to
00:06:05 - 00:06:09: send it Mike's like maybe we send him
00:06:07 - 00:06:12: some flowers and this there was a
00:06:09 - 00:06:13: conversation where you guys were holding
00:06:12 - 00:06:15: them back it was in this game cuz you
00:06:13 - 00:06:16: guys play a lot of games together I know
00:06:15 - 00:06:18: but like there was something where in
00:06:16 - 00:06:19: the rank thing he was getting pulled
00:06:18 - 00:06:21: back because of you guys yeah are you
00:06:19 - 00:06:22: familiar with like ranked play I mean
00:06:21 - 00:06:24: the
00:06:22 - 00:06:27: concept so ranked play I'm not sure how
00:06:24 - 00:06:29: it is for like uh for other games of the
00:06:27 - 00:06:31: same ilk but for Call of Duty you have
00:06:29 - 00:06:33: to buy in you have to buy in with what's
00:06:31 - 00:06:34: called Sr points and you get a certain
00:06:33 - 00:06:37: amount of Sr points like so right now
00:06:34 - 00:06:40: I'm chasing Platinum 3 which is 4,800
00:06:37 - 00:06:42: points I got 150 to go but it cost you
00:06:40 - 00:06:44: 50 to buy in gotta so if you don't go
00:06:42 - 00:06:45: positive you start sliding backward and
00:06:44 - 00:06:47: they're all diamond so they're they're
00:06:45 - 00:06:49: buy in's like 75 or something crazy like
00:06:47 - 00:06:51: that so we played the first three games
00:06:49 - 00:06:53: well but then after a while dud like the
00:06:51 - 00:06:55: games fatigue you you get to a certain
00:06:53 - 00:06:57: point start and so you start making
00:06:55 - 00:06:58: dumbass decisions it's like real
00:06:57 - 00:07:00: gambling where like another one I got to
00:06:58 - 00:07:01: get it back I can feel I can get it I
00:07:00 - 00:07:03: can do it and you and you just do and
00:07:01 - 00:07:04: like every once in a while you'll win
00:07:03 - 00:07:06: and you'll win and you'll get like
00:07:04 - 00:07:08: you'll be up like 65 you feel great um
00:07:06 - 00:07:10: and then yeah so we had some issues the
00:07:08 - 00:07:11: other I have never gone beyond plat 3
00:07:10 - 00:07:13: I'm trying to get diamond okay yeah
00:07:11 - 00:07:15: that's the goal the diamond it's pretty
00:07:13 - 00:07:16: fun it's fun add some Stakes to it
00:07:15 - 00:07:18: exactly and then but that's what I'm
00:07:16 - 00:07:21: saying is you get better at it then when
00:07:18 - 00:07:23: I go play normal like rebirth just
00:07:21 - 00:07:25: unranked I feel myself being better than
00:07:23 - 00:07:28: the other players that aren't
00:07:25 - 00:07:30: cheating for the most part there's 50/50
00:07:28 - 00:07:31: in that when you play Call of dut you'll
00:07:30 - 00:07:33: see a guy just laser like or just snap
00:07:31 - 00:07:34: onto you from across the map you're like
00:07:33 - 00:07:36: okay that guy's definitely cheating
00:07:34 - 00:07:37: which I can't for the life of me figure
00:07:36 - 00:07:39: out how they can't figure out how to not
00:07:37 - 00:07:42: get cheaters in that game sort of out
00:07:39 - 00:07:45: Call of Duty you know what I mean
00:07:42 - 00:07:47: yeah him yes I have a serious question

00:09:42 - 00:09:45: while since there's been any that I felt

00:10:49 - 00:10:53: was oh no Happy Father's Day to you all

00:10:57 - 00:11:02: the American road trip haha
00:10:59 - 00:11:05: on a side note I saw warships off my
00:11:02 - 00:11:07: country's Shores hm I'm not the Tucker
00:11:05 - 00:11:10: type as a father my kids live in that
00:11:07 - 00:11:12: country hm Putin I will fly to the
00:11:10 - 00:11:15: Caribbean come have dinner let's not let
00:11:12 - 00:11:18: foolishness dictate the future hash
00:11:15 - 00:11:22: Happy Father's he's Dennis Rodman in it
00:11:18 - 00:11:24: what the actual [ __ ] yes so that's a lot
00:11:22 - 00:11:25: to unpack it's just a lot that makes
00:11:24 - 00:11:27: more sense for the comic Kevin show it
00:11:25 - 00:11:29: again that makes more sense for one of
00:11:27 - 00:11:31: the comments there cuz when it just said
00:11:29 - 00:11:33: this stuff and I read it this one person
00:11:31 - 00:11:35: Elena responds Vladimir Putin is an
00:11:33 - 00:11:37: amazing father hard he is working hard
00:11:35 - 00:11:39: to get Havana syndrome shut down in the
00:11:37 - 00:11:41: Caribbean uh first up that's a lot D
00:11:39 - 00:11:42: pack too guarantee that's a bot right
00:11:41 - 00:11:44: there's no way that's a real human being
00:11:42 - 00:11:46: that's like a Putin Russian bot that's
00:11:44 - 00:11:47: that's programmed anytime they see Putin
00:11:46 - 00:11:50: to just do something positive about
00:11:47 - 00:11:52: Putin wild stuff though I I'm just
00:11:50 - 00:11:54: scrolling yesterday I'm seeing all these
00:11:52 - 00:11:57: pictures of Ben pictures of like all my
00:11:54 - 00:11:59: friends kids and [ __ ] then I see oh [ __ ]
00:11:57 - 00:12:01: like vids posted some fast 10 stuff wow
00:11:59 - 00:12:02: also is that AI generated that looks
00:12:01 - 00:12:04: thing too I mean it's concept art so
00:12:02 - 00:12:07: like who the hell knows you that looks
00:12:04 - 00:12:08: AI generated but I wouldn't be surprised
00:12:07 - 00:12:09: it also trips me out thought I was like
00:12:08 - 00:12:11: wait why is the why is the driver on the
00:12:09 - 00:12:12: right side but then he's like oh maybe
00:12:11 - 00:12:14: he's in Europe maybe that's a London an
00:12:12 - 00:12:15: American road trip I don't know that's
00:12:14 - 00:12:17: true well that's the other funny thing
00:12:15 - 00:12:19: I'm while location scout in Europe oh I
00:12:17 - 00:12:21: guess not it's not no to be fair let's
00:12:19 - 00:12:23: let's unpack this shout out to him for
00:12:21 - 00:12:26: doing reic 4 I'm very excited about that
00:12:23 - 00:12:27: as you guys know I love reic 4 I hope he
00:12:26 - 00:12:29: doesn't get cancelled before then for
00:12:27 - 00:12:32: his United love of Tucker I don't know
00:12:29 - 00:12:33: what's going on with that comment I said
00:12:32 - 00:12:35: I'm not the Tucker I there yeah but he
00:12:33 - 00:12:37: said it ironically like I'm not I'm not
00:12:35 - 00:12:39: the Shan Hannity type but you know what
00:12:37 - 00:12:41: I mean was that is that did I read that
00:12:39 - 00:12:43: incorrectly how I heard it but it was
00:12:41 - 00:12:49: like yeah I'm not like I don't support
00:12:43 - 00:12:51: FOX news comma but TR any God I I think
00:12:49 - 00:12:53: it I think it was the opposite I think
00:12:51 - 00:12:55: it I read it again read it again I or
00:12:53 - 00:12:56: can I I'll find it on the internet too
00:12:55 - 00:12:58: yeah this is one of those ones I need to
00:12:56 - 00:13:00: see this is like like a game show on
00:12:58 - 00:13:01: math yeah mean that's the problem too
00:13:00 - 00:13:04: there was a lot of spelling
00:13:01 - 00:13:05: errors grammar issues so so it's like
00:13:04 - 00:13:06: reading one of my a text from my mom
00:13:05 - 00:13:08: where you're like I'm not sure if you're
00:13:06 - 00:13:10: mad at me or happy with me cuz cuz
00:13:08 - 00:13:12: you're doing all caps no no punctuation
00:13:10 - 00:13:14: whatsoever Kev I'm going to send another
00:13:12 - 00:13:16: link to assets that's uh the vulture

00:13:16 - 00:13:21: dinner in Father's Day post it's wild I
00:13:19 - 00:13:24: mean like it's of course deleting it I
00:13:21 - 00:13:26: guess makes sense um but this is just
00:13:24 - 00:13:27: the typical type of post he does you
00:13:26 - 00:13:30: know what I mean this one's a little
00:13:27 - 00:13:32: more weird dies celebrate every facet of
00:13:30 - 00:13:34: his F of his fatherhood this Father's
00:13:32 - 00:13:36: Day what does that mean glad you asked
00:13:34 - 00:13:38: diesel acknowledges kids in his post
00:13:36 - 00:13:40: sure but only in passing and as part of
00:13:38 - 00:13:43: a dinner invite to Vladimir
00:13:40 - 00:13:45: Putin yeah that's if you scroll down Kev

00:13:48 - 00:13:54: bit no no sorry the up on the page right
00:13:52 - 00:13:57: there on on a side note I saw warships
00:13:54 - 00:13:59: off my country's Shore hm I am not the
00:13:57 - 00:14:01: Tucker type dot dot dot see when you
00:13:59 - 00:14:04: write I'm not the Tucker type dot dot
00:14:01 - 00:14:05: dot to me that reads but as a father my
00:14:04 - 00:14:09: kids live in this community we should
00:14:05 - 00:14:11: fig I don't know country excuse me uh H
00:14:09 - 00:14:14: Putin I will fly to the car Caribbean
00:14:11 - 00:14:15: come have dinner why the Caribbean
00:14:14 - 00:14:18: what's going on with the warships are
00:14:15 - 00:14:20: they went to Pearl Harbor who knows we
00:14:18 - 00:14:23: don't [ __ ] know where he's at he says
00:14:20 - 00:14:26: I'm in Europe I saw worships off my
00:14:23 - 00:14:29: Country Shores is he talking about the
00:14:26 - 00:14:31: country his original country of birth I
00:14:29 - 00:14:33: think so so where where is he from in
00:14:31 - 00:14:34: Europe cuz I thought he was American I
00:14:33 - 00:14:36: don't know where the Caribbean comes
00:14:34 - 00:14:38: into play I don't know wasn't there some
00:14:36 - 00:14:42: uh like the there's a bunch of like
00:14:38 - 00:14:44: Russian ships like going to different
00:14:42 - 00:14:46: areas to be like strategically placed if
00:14:44 - 00:14:50: anything were to happen I don't maybe
00:14:46 - 00:14:53: but I mean I are they off the coast of
00:14:50 - 00:14:56: Florida I think so that sounds wild we
00:14:53 - 00:14:59: wouldn't let this [ __ ] happen it's
00:14:56 - 00:15:01: international waters though
00:14:59 - 00:15:03: but I know I think when you say I see
00:15:01 - 00:15:05: warships off the coast of my sure I
00:15:03 - 00:15:06: think it means to me I maybe I take it
00:15:05 - 00:15:07: too literally that you can actually
00:15:06 - 00:15:09: physically see the warships off the
00:15:07 - 00:15:12: coast when you're standing on the side I
00:15:09 - 00:15:15: mean that's what I assume that man he's
00:15:12 - 00:15:16: I I yeah man that's weird again maybe we
00:15:15 - 00:15:19: just need to switch him to like a nice
00:15:16 - 00:15:20: sativa blend when before and then take
00:15:19 - 00:15:23: the phone away from him when he stop
00:15:20 - 00:15:26: when he starts Instagram blogging on
00:15:23 - 00:15:28: August 19th 2014 Vox had the headline
00:15:26 - 00:15:31: Vin Diesel names Vladimir Putin to the
00:15:28 - 00:15:33: ice [ __ ] challenge amazing so they
00:15:31 - 00:15:35: have a pre-existing relationship they're
00:15:33 - 00:15:37: probably pretty close I mean you feel
00:15:35 - 00:15:38: like you definitely want to be in a good
00:15:37 - 00:15:40: company with like Steven Seagal and
00:15:38 - 00:15:41: hanging out with Putin you know is that
00:15:40 - 00:15:42: what he's doing Steven Seagal went to pu
00:15:41 - 00:15:44: went to Russia for a while he was like
00:15:42 - 00:15:47: hanging out with Putin for a while huh
00:15:44 - 00:15:49: yeah it's a go of course uh let's see uh
00:15:47 - 00:15:51: oh Gavin Olson says Russian ship's
00:15:49 - 00:15:52: currently in Cuba well okay great we're
00:15:51 - 00:15:54: headed toward another Cuban Missile
00:15:52 - 00:15:57: Crisis isn't that going to be fun for
00:15:54 - 00:15:58: everyone huh it's Russian ships in Cuba
00:15:57 - 00:16:00: okay well I mean technically I guess
00:15:58 - 00:16:04: that would be off the coasts of Florida
00:16:00 - 00:16:06: if they're near Cuba right Kevin that
00:16:04 - 00:16:08: makes sense
00:16:06 - 00:16:10: yep hard to believe Vin has more
00:16:08 - 00:16:12: informed on the world events than Nick
00:16:10 - 00:16:14: LOL H that's fair enough I mean he's
00:16:12 - 00:16:17: World traveled he is of the world he
00:16:14 - 00:16:20: looks like Mr worldwide so yeah got that
00:16:17 - 00:16:24: going for him shout out to P huh it's a
00:16:20 - 00:16:25: concept an entity he just a performer
00:16:24 - 00:16:27: yeah I mean just to think about the
00:16:25 - 00:16:30: amount of Fast and Furious soundtracks
00:16:27 - 00:16:32: he's had songs on it's it's very
00:16:30 - 00:16:34: impressive it is impressive for the
00:16:32 - 00:16:37: Decades of that franchise and Pit's been
00:16:34 - 00:16:39: there since not day one but day two
00:16:37 - 00:16:40: what's the release schedule for 10 part
00:16:39 - 00:16:43: two Lord knows we don't know Lord
00:16:40 - 00:16:45: [ __ ] are they filming not yet there's
00:16:43 - 00:16:46: so there's so much conflicting [ __ ] like
00:16:45 - 00:16:48: I we're in the era of Vin Diesel just
00:16:46 - 00:16:51: saying stuff and then like the studios
00:16:48 - 00:16:54: being like what what I mean I bet that
00:16:51 - 00:16:55: is AI I bet that was not sent to him by
00:16:54 - 00:16:58: conceptt artist I mean he just saw it
00:16:55 - 00:17:00: was like oh it looks cool you know cuz
00:16:58 - 00:17:02: wasn't at one point didn't he say hey
00:17:00 - 00:17:04: it's going to be a Trilogy Studio's like
00:17:02 - 00:17:06: w what are you talking about yeah he
00:17:04 - 00:17:08: said it was going to be 10 was going to
00:17:06 - 00:17:10: be a trilogy but now because of the poor
00:17:08 - 00:17:12: performance of 10 and like the
00:17:10 - 00:17:14: ballooning budgets the the word on the
00:17:12 - 00:17:16: street is that Universal's like back to
00:17:14 - 00:17:18: the roots we're just staying in La let's
00:17:16 - 00:17:21: do a very small car story I love that
00:17:18 - 00:17:23: and like no biggest one ever it has to
00:17:21 - 00:17:25: be the biggest ever got to go to I mean
00:17:23 - 00:17:26: here's the thing I'm all about it no
00:17:25 - 00:17:29: matter what happens like at this point
00:17:26 - 00:17:31: they [ __ ] everything up so bad but
00:17:29 - 00:17:33: without spoiling anything with the way
00:17:31 - 00:17:35: they ended 10 you can't just go to a
00:17:33 - 00:17:37: small thing after that it'd be the most
00:17:35 - 00:17:39: bizarre [ __ ] I don't even remember I was
00:17:37 - 00:17:41: going to ask you can you
00:17:39 - 00:17:43: spoil I can do the whole thing of like
00:17:41 - 00:17:45: I'll tap my head of video listeners when
00:17:43 - 00:17:47: it's over and audio listeners just make
00:17:45 - 00:17:50: a sound of a goose we'll make a sound of
00:17:47 - 00:17:54: a goose when it's done yeah so how they
00:17:50 - 00:17:55: know give us 30 seconds expl 30 seconds
00:17:54 - 00:17:59: Skip One 30 seconds from now starting
00:17:55 - 00:18:02: now go The Rock's back yeah gazelle's
00:17:59 - 00:18:05: back oh right came back like that's
00:18:02 - 00:18:08: insane Hans still alive or dead Hans
00:18:05 - 00:18:11: well it ended on a cliffhanger of Vin

00:19:10 - 00:19:15: such a very very like low budge $17
00:19:12 - 00:19:17: million budget whatever it was ton just
00:19:15 - 00:19:19: horribly miscast in that film no shout
00:19:17 - 00:19:22: out to ton love her but but I'm watching
00:19:19 - 00:19:23: this with d and she's like why would

00:19:30 - 00:19:34: yeah she seems like she's got like she
00:19:32 - 00:19:36: should not be in this role at all anyway
00:19:34 - 00:19:38: long story short watching that movie and
00:19:36 - 00:19:39: seeing how small it was and seeing like
00:19:38 - 00:19:41: just the dumb little stupid story they
00:19:39 - 00:19:43: cobbled together through all the Improv
00:19:41 - 00:19:45: and all the rewrites and all this stuff
00:19:43 - 00:19:48: it it and then reading trivia about Bad
00:19:45 - 00:19:50: Boys 2 how that at one point in Bad Boys
00:19:48 - 00:19:52: 2 while they were filming on one side of
00:19:50 - 00:19:54: Miami Fast and Furious 2 was filming on
00:19:52 - 00:19:57: the other side and I'm like oh man those

00:20:58 - 00:21:01: were doing any of our content any of our
00:21:00 - 00:21:03: podcasts I used to have this knee
00:21:01 - 00:21:05: problem that felt like my knee was going
00:21:03 - 00:21:07: to explode oh my God like I would be
00:21:05 - 00:21:10: sitting there in the the worst ever was
00:21:07 - 00:21:13: I was in a movie on a date and like I it
00:21:10 - 00:21:14: just like searing insane pain in my knee
00:21:13 - 00:21:17: to the point that I had to get up and
00:21:14 - 00:21:18: just stand up in the row like to stretch
00:21:17 - 00:21:21: out like to elongate my knee or it was
00:21:18 - 00:21:24: going to [ __ ] pop yeah you watching I
00:21:21 - 00:21:25: don't remember doesn't matter no I was

00:21:25 - 00:21:30: say maybe dark KN Rises that's not right
00:21:28 - 00:21:32: uh but it was like so [ __ ] horribly
00:21:30 - 00:21:34: bad and I like you know it happened a
00:21:32 - 00:21:35: few more times if the knee would if I
00:21:34 - 00:21:37: would just leave my knee bent without
00:21:35 - 00:21:39: being able to move it or whatever so I
00:21:37 - 00:21:41: uh went to the doctor these [ __ ]
00:21:39 - 00:21:43: don't know anything you know what I mean
00:21:41 - 00:21:44: they they took one look at me I'm like I

00:21:50 - 00:21:53: super sad about it and I I got ready to

00:21:53 - 00:21:57: it I might even bought other shoes or
00:21:55 - 00:22:00: whatever but I was lamenting the whole

00:25:02 - 00:25:08: great time yeah how do you feel about uh
00:25:06 - 00:25:10: Destiny I it's I don't understand why
00:25:08 - 00:25:12: people like every time I I you know I go
00:25:10 - 00:25:14: to Andy's stream at random points and I
00:25:12 - 00:25:16: like to ask him where the bodies are at
00:25:14 - 00:25:16: leave the
00:25:17 - 00:25:20: chat and uh but I got I got on there
00:25:19 - 00:25:22: last night and I saw him playing with
00:25:20 - 00:25:24: Mike and I'm like um Nick can't be happy
00:25:22 - 00:25:26: about this uh no I'm fine I mean I'm
00:25:24 - 00:25:29: fine with it obviously Mike can do what
00:25:26 - 00:25:30: he wants to do um I just I played
00:25:29 - 00:25:33: Destiny maybe I think we tried playing
00:25:30 - 00:25:35: it three or four days in a row with
00:25:33 - 00:25:37: Chris sort of leading us and it's just
00:25:35 - 00:25:38: way it was back in like I think it was
00:25:37 - 00:25:40: like a year ago right when the studio
00:25:38 - 00:25:41: launched and I was like I just don't
00:25:40 - 00:25:44: understand why people love this it just
00:25:41 - 00:25:45: feels like there's so many menus and so
00:25:44 - 00:25:47: much [ __ ] to go through yeah and then
00:25:45 - 00:25:49: when you get to the actual gameplay this
00:25:47 - 00:25:51: is the big problem I have with that is
00:25:49 - 00:25:53: it just feels pre-programmed and doesn't
00:25:51 - 00:25:55: feel like it's spontaneous you're just I
00:25:53 - 00:25:56: don't know it doesn't feel like you get
00:25:55 - 00:25:58: the same level of action that you get
00:25:56 - 00:25:59: when you're actually playing against for
00:25:58 - 00:26:01: the most part real human beings yeah
00:25:59 - 00:26:04: when you do PVP you like in Call of Duty
00:26:01 - 00:26:06: yeah you know I don't know Mike i m
00:26:04 - 00:26:08: depending on whatever whoever asks Mike
00:26:06 - 00:26:09: either loves Destiny or hates it sure
00:26:08 - 00:26:11: Mike's a chameleon yeah he really is
00:26:09 - 00:26:13: he'll blend in wherever he's just full
00:26:11 - 00:26:16: of it he wants somebody to be on the
00:26:13 - 00:26:17: inside with Putin Mike snowbike Mike you
00:26:16 - 00:26:20: put Mike in a room with Putin all wars
00:26:17 - 00:26:21: are done all he would just come back and
00:26:20 - 00:26:22: be able to tell us everything you know
00:26:21 - 00:26:24: but he would agree with everything so po
00:26:22 - 00:26:26: would think he's an ally and then we'd
00:26:24 - 00:26:27: have to question where is oh for sure
00:26:26 - 00:26:29: the FBI would have some questions the
00:26:27 - 00:26:31: CIA would have some question for you
00:26:29 - 00:26:33: hate to see it you know cuz Mike would
00:26:31 - 00:26:35: fold Under Pressure he wouldn't do well
00:26:33 - 00:26:37: with the CIA when they start examining
00:26:35 - 00:26:39: him in that in the room he I mean they'd
00:26:37 - 00:26:42: take away his giant bottle of water and
00:26:39 - 00:26:45: he'd crumble like a house of cards just
00:26:42 - 00:26:47: bad he's a guy that Mike he really is a

00:29:03 - 00:29:06: that's how he would have wanted I had a
00:29:04 - 00:29:08: nice little not like I had one of those
00:29:06 - 00:29:11: like you know nods that I was right kind
00:29:08 - 00:29:12: of moments from Jen the other day where
00:29:11 - 00:29:14: I didn't watch that into the wild with
00:29:12 - 00:29:17: her that I remember maybe I did I don't
00:29:14 - 00:29:20: think I did though but maybe I did and I
00:29:17 - 00:29:21: first watch was very much like with all
00:29:20 - 00:29:24: due respect [ __ ] this kid you know what
00:29:21 - 00:29:26: I mean like everyone telling you not
00:29:24 - 00:29:27: everyone is trying to be nice to you and
00:29:26 - 00:29:28: you like it's like well just no this
00:29:27 - 00:29:30: ain't
00:29:28 - 00:29:31: and then but I guess when she saw it the
00:29:30 - 00:29:33: first time she didn't she was younger
00:29:31 - 00:29:34: and didn't have that interpretation of
00:29:33 - 00:29:36: it as much and then she watched it
00:29:34 - 00:29:40: recently with her sister and they both
00:29:36 - 00:29:41: were like yo there were a lot of places
00:29:40 - 00:29:43: for him not to get completely dead by
00:29:41 - 00:29:45: the end of this and he ignored all the
00:29:43 - 00:29:46: people trying to help him and be a good
00:29:45 - 00:29:47: person because yeah you wanted to Rebel
00:29:46 - 00:29:51: or whatever yeah I think that I think
00:29:47 - 00:29:53: when you're younger and when life is
00:29:51 - 00:29:55: what's up it probably from Kansas no no

00:29:55 - 00:30:01: 127 Hours
00:29:58 - 00:30:05: 27 hours and IC says imagine cutting
00:30:01 - 00:30:08: your arm off after 27

00:30:16 - 00:30:20: going to go out here to kill yourself

00:30:50 - 00:30:53: Lillard was kind of on the decline Seth
00:30:51 - 00:30:55: Green was like he did Can't Hardly Wait
00:30:53 - 00:30:56: I was like I'm I mean don't get me wrong
00:30:55 - 00:30:57: I'm a Seth Green fan but I was like I
00:30:56 - 00:30:58: don't know that I need to rush out to

00:31:02 - 00:31:05: podcast apparently he's got this great
00:31:04 - 00:31:07: podcast that he does but he was always
00:31:05 - 00:31:10: one of those guys that I was like you
00:31:07 - 00:31:12: came from like an MTV reality show you
00:31:10 - 00:31:15: got to prove yourself to me Dak Shepard
00:31:12 - 00:31:17: and it I don't think it wasn't until man
00:31:15 - 00:31:19: I don't think it was until [ __ ] uh
00:31:17 - 00:31:21: idiocracy that I was like this guy's got
00:31:19 - 00:31:24: the stuff this guy's got the stuff for
00:31:21 - 00:31:26: me what reality show punked I want to
00:31:24 - 00:31:28: say pun was didn't he come from that or
00:31:26 - 00:31:29: maybe he came from no he came from Punk
00:31:28 - 00:31:31: but I reality show makes it sound like
00:31:29 - 00:31:32: real world maybe I'm thinking maybe I'm
00:31:31 - 00:31:34: thinking it was punked I just remember
00:31:32 - 00:31:36: he was he was punked he was on pun he
00:31:34 - 00:31:38: was an MTV guy reality shows were
00:31:36 - 00:31:40: [ __ ] crazy during that era man like
00:31:38 - 00:31:41: VH1 they would just do anything
00:31:40 - 00:31:43: obviously for real life all this stuff
00:31:41 - 00:31:45: there was a show it was only one season
00:31:43 - 00:31:47: nobody's surprised called the white
00:31:45 - 00:31:49: rapper show uh you also wouldn't be
00:31:47 - 00:31:51: surprised that I was obsessed with it of
00:31:49 - 00:31:53: course did you think about entering yeah
00:31:51 - 00:31:54: no no no no and like and no at one point
00:31:53 - 00:31:55: at no point did you think I could
00:31:54 - 00:31:58: probably take that [ __ ] no no no
00:31:55 - 00:32:00: definitely not well no cuz like it even
00:31:58 - 00:32:03: watching it like it it was it was
00:32:00 - 00:32:05: horrible but it's also amazing so much
00:32:03 - 00:32:06: so that I was like I wonder what's up
00:32:05 - 00:32:08: with this [ __ ] show not on streaming
00:32:06 - 00:32:10: services which is definitely a bummer

00:32:21 - 00:32:26: [ __ ] that is said and done
00:32:23 - 00:32:28: is incomprehensible I I can't believe
00:32:26 - 00:32:30: that there was any point that some these
00:32:28 - 00:32:32: people would do or same things they did
00:32:30 - 00:32:34: it does cross the line in many ways of
00:32:32 - 00:32:36: like oh that is not good but in other
00:32:34 - 00:32:40: ways it's just like I mean dude freaking

00:37:27 - 00:37:31: if we're turn this into the appreciation
00:37:29 - 00:37:33: podcast for Dak Shepard it's just the
00:37:31 - 00:37:35: fact that him and his wife Chris Kristen
00:37:33 - 00:37:36: Bell right Kristen Bell Christ Krist
00:37:35 - 00:37:38: Bell like they're just in commercials

00:37:38 - 00:37:41: Hollywood couple and they do [ __ ]
00:37:39 - 00:37:43: together to make money anytime I see a
00:37:41 - 00:37:44: Hollywood couple that's still married
00:37:43 - 00:37:45: and still seems like they like each
00:37:44 - 00:37:47: other I think it's a win you put that in

00:44:11 - 00:44:14: theory about JLo and she starts going
00:44:12 - 00:44:16: down the rabbit hole and it turned this
00:44:14 - 00:44:18: whole thing and then AO and JLo were on
00:44:16 - 00:44:20: SNL together and it was like they had a
00:44:18 - 00:44:21: moment whatever lot of us happened you
00:44:20 - 00:44:23: should look into this because it's very
00:44:21 - 00:44:26: interesting uh but the your homework
00:44:23 - 00:44:30: okay the craziest thing though is I was
00:44:26 - 00:44:34: reading ao's like like Parts AO at air
00:44:30 - 00:44:36: uh from the bear oh okay yeah she had a
00:44:34 - 00:44:38: fey about J yeah yeah comedy like she
00:44:36 - 00:44:39: was just like like just like this just
00:44:38 - 00:44:42: [ __ ] talking but end up getting taken
00:44:39 - 00:44:43: out it would be like if if D sheer if me
00:44:42 - 00:44:45: and then that was cool and then being D
00:44:43 - 00:44:46: sh became best friends holy [ __ ] I
00:44:45 - 00:44:48: manifested well they didn't become best
00:44:46 - 00:44:51: friends but I'm saying the Splinter Cy
00:44:48 - 00:44:52: Universe it it would be the same energy
00:44:51 - 00:44:55: can I please be best friends with Dak
00:44:52 - 00:44:56: Shepard that's what I'm saying so um
00:44:55 - 00:44:58: they're going back through a list of
00:44:56 - 00:44:59: songs that like J's not singing on and
00:44:58 - 00:45:01: it's like you know there's Ghost Riders
00:44:59 - 00:45:03: that's just like a normal thing in music
00:45:01 - 00:45:04: industry that's been forever the back of
00:45:03 - 00:45:06: vocals or this or that or whatever but
00:45:04 - 00:45:08: then it's like oh these like classic JLo
00:45:06 - 00:45:09: songs it's not like weird deep Cuts or
00:45:08 - 00:45:12: anything it's like JLo songs that I've
00:45:09 - 00:45:14: heard a hundred times at least and I go
00:45:12 - 00:45:15: back and I listen someone's like Hey
00:45:14 - 00:45:18: listen to this like actually listen to
00:45:15 - 00:45:21: this and ask yourself is this JLo or is
00:45:18 - 00:45:23: this Christina Milan and I listen to it
00:45:21 - 00:45:25: and I'm like that's [ __ ] Christina
00:45:23 - 00:45:28: Milan like it's not just random singers
00:45:25 - 00:45:29: it's other it's crazy to me that they
00:45:28 - 00:45:33: would have done that though cuz she's a
00:45:29 - 00:45:34: big deal she's not giving a [ __ ] Z man I
00:45:33 - 00:45:37: mean they got away with it for years
00:45:34 - 00:45:38: she's PO for years not JLA has she
00:45:37 - 00:45:40: responded to these allegations yeah I
00:45:38 - 00:45:42: mean she Al she put out that this is me
00:45:40 - 00:45:44: now movie thing experence what she said
00:45:42 - 00:45:47: was this I don't give a
00:45:44 - 00:45:49: [ __ ] so rich was like all right she had
00:45:47 - 00:45:52: to cancel a tour did she yeah oh things
00:45:49 - 00:45:53: are not going well for JLo right now I I
00:45:52 - 00:45:55: mean no wonder she's got problems with
00:45:53 - 00:45:56: Ben you know that's tough professional
00:45:55 - 00:46:00: stress personal stress that's bad bad
00:45:56 - 00:46:01: comination it's it's you can't do that
00:46:00 - 00:46:04: man you got to be you got to be at least
00:46:01 - 00:46:06: singing some of your [ __ ] yeah and
00:46:04 - 00:46:07: apparently she does think some of it but
00:46:06 - 00:46:10: like there are songs where the majority
00:46:07 - 00:46:12: of it is not her that's wild it's just
00:46:10 - 00:46:14: crazy and like the fact that it's like a
00:46:12 - 00:46:17: known like there's often uncredited
00:46:14 - 00:46:19: singers on things like Flite like his
00:46:17 - 00:46:22: one of his first big hits was that right
00:46:19 - 00:46:22: round song you
00:46:23 - 00:46:29: know and like that the CH was Kesha but
00:46:27 - 00:46:30: like it was before Kesha was big so it
00:46:29 - 00:46:32: literally was just a flowr song it
00:46:30 - 00:46:33: didn't say featuring anybody and
00:46:32 - 00:46:35: retroactively they went back and now it
00:46:33 - 00:46:37: says featuring Kesha when it first
00:46:35 - 00:46:40: dropped on the yeah exactly you want
00:46:37 - 00:46:41: that but it's like these are just JLo
00:46:40 - 00:46:44: songs that don't take featuring anybody
00:46:41 - 00:46:47: and it's like contemporaries of hers
00:46:44 - 00:46:49: it's just wild stuff that's crazy that's
00:46:47 - 00:46:51: crazy but she's still
00:46:49 - 00:46:53: singing sometimes performing too and
00:46:51 - 00:46:55: that's the thing too she is performing
00:46:53 - 00:46:58: she's a performer she obviously has been
00:46:55 - 00:47:00: a phenomenal life when she sings Booty
00:46:58 - 00:47:03: with that girl cool girl doesn't like
00:47:00 - 00:47:06: Iggy Iggy oh man booty that was a moment
00:47:03 - 00:47:09: it was that was a moment in time big big
00:47:06 - 00:47:10: booty cuz Greg got that big booty work
00:47:09 - 00:47:12: you know what I mean yeah yeah when it
00:47:10 - 00:47:13: comes on the shuffle I don't stop it you
00:47:12 - 00:47:16: know what I mean [ __ ] no I got to put
00:47:13 - 00:47:17: that back in the rotation I mean anytime

00:47:17 - 00:47:21: have it don't worry about I'll tell you

00:50:00 - 00:50:04: when I buy something and I talk to
00:50:02 - 00:50:06: someone else and I realize I weigh
00:50:04 - 00:50:08: overspent and they got it for cheaper
00:50:06 - 00:50:10: it's happened to all of us but getting
00:50:08 - 00:50:11: ripped off is no joke especially when
00:50:10 - 00:50:13: there's razors involved the people at
00:50:11 - 00:50:15: Harry's were tired of seeing everyday

00:51:26 - 00:51:30: unexpected and disturbing results the
00:51:28 - 00:51:32: team fell apart under strange
00:51:30 - 00:51:34: circumstances and the project was
00:51:32 - 00:51:36: abandoned the game world and the super
00:51:34 - 00:51:39: intelligence within were discarded left
00:51:36 - 00:51:41: dormant and undiscovered until now I
00:51:39 - 00:51:42: listen to episode one on my way to work
00:51:41 - 00:51:44: today and the thing that stood out of
00:51:42 - 00:51:46: course are the performances but then as
00:51:44 - 00:51:48: an audio drama fan it was the use of
00:51:46 - 00:51:50: monologues there's a whole bunch of
00:51:48 - 00:51:52: talking here as it sets up the world
00:51:50 - 00:51:53: that is not that far from us in the
00:51:52 - 00:51:56: timeline and also not that far from us
00:51:53 - 00:51:57: in the technology which is disturbing
00:51:56 - 00:51:59: but I'm quite interested to see where it
00:51:57 - 00:52:01: goes a better Paradise is out now and

00:52:09 - 00:52:17: episode Tim mhm we are less than two
00:52:14 - 00:52:19: weeks from your wedding
00:52:17 - 00:52:22: NS how are we feeling we haven't
00:52:19 - 00:52:25: actually talked about yeah this
00:52:22 - 00:52:27: immediacy of your wedding yet it's uh I
00:52:25 - 00:52:28: I I we've talked a little bit and I feel
00:52:27 - 00:52:30: like the thing that I said that just
00:52:28 - 00:52:31: keeps being more and more true is I'm
00:52:30 - 00:52:36: really
00:52:31 - 00:52:38: realizing how getting older affects you
00:52:36 - 00:52:40: like and it's it's very it's a morbid
00:52:38 - 00:52:42: thing I just blew up my niece 100 yeah
00:52:40 - 00:52:45: and it's crazy cuz I'm getting married

00:52:48 - 00:52:54: present which is fun giving to yourself
00:52:49 - 00:52:57: present of Love 100% but I really don't
00:52:54 - 00:52:59: like that I don't got it like I used to

00:52:59 - 00:53:03: lot of people are just like there
00:53:00 - 00:53:04: there's so many things that blow my mind
00:53:03 - 00:53:06: but it's the internet and it's people so
00:53:04 - 00:53:08: I shouldn't be surprised sure but the
00:53:06 - 00:53:10: amount of people that are like you've

00:53:55 - 00:53:59: this type of [ __ ] I love the production
00:53:57 - 00:54:01: literally it is like my passion in life
00:53:59 - 00:54:03: is this type of thing and when it's
00:54:01 - 00:54:07: about me and Gia it's even more like
00:54:03 - 00:54:08: it's the most like I I can't believe I
00:54:07 - 00:54:09: have this opportunity I can't believe I
00:54:08 - 00:54:11: have so many creative people around me
00:54:09 - 00:54:15: to help I think that's the thing that I
00:54:11 - 00:54:17: love the most about it is how many of my
00:54:15 - 00:54:19: friends are helping work on things and
00:54:17 - 00:54:20: then how many of my friends I'm not
00:54:19 - 00:54:22: having work cuz I just want them to
00:54:20 - 00:54:24: enjoy it or like take it in or surprise
00:54:22 - 00:54:26: them cuz usually like I think you guys
00:54:24 - 00:54:28: are even good examples I I putting Nick
00:54:26 - 00:54:31: to work but
00:54:28 - 00:54:33: uh but like I I just want it to be kind
00:54:31 - 00:54:36: of like a surprise and like fun stuff
00:54:33 - 00:54:37: like from that perspective uh I'm sorry
00:54:36 - 00:54:39: if I'm speaking like an idiot because I
00:54:37 - 00:54:40: haven't slept much so it's hard to get
00:54:39 - 00:54:42: my thoughts together you know what I
00:54:40 - 00:54:45: mean yeah um you don't sound like any by
00:54:42 - 00:54:46: the way but but anyways with the no more
00:54:45 - 00:54:49: than normal with with yeah exactly
00:54:46 - 00:54:50: exactly but with with all of this uh and
00:54:49 - 00:54:53: I totally lost my train of thought but
00:54:50 - 00:54:54: where it's going down to is like I'm so
00:54:53 - 00:54:58: happy I'm doing this I love doing this
00:54:54 - 00:55:01: but I can't believe how much more taxing
00:54:58 - 00:55:03: video editing or like working on ideas
00:55:01 - 00:55:05: or like trying to put like Words down on
00:55:03 - 00:55:06: paper of like this is how this is going
00:55:05 - 00:55:09: to go and all that stuff it's just like
00:55:06 - 00:55:12: I'm it's not firing the way it used to
00:55:09 - 00:55:14: and like I hate it you know like I and

00:55:26 - 00:55:30: things but like I've been prettyy damn
00:55:28 - 00:55:31: good about that but even with that I'll
00:55:30 - 00:55:34: wake up the next day and I'm just like
00:55:31 - 00:55:36: [ __ ] like I feel like half of me and I
00:55:34 - 00:55:37: don't know not to turn this into such a
00:55:36 - 00:55:39: bummer but it's like just being real
00:55:37 - 00:55:41: it's like it's kind of scary for me

00:57:02 - 00:57:07: break down here and and this is a funny
00:57:04 - 00:57:08: thing I've been conscious about not
00:57:07 - 00:57:10: bringing up the wedding like I've been
00:57:08 - 00:57:12: trying to like not do that like not talk

00:57:12 - 00:57:17: right here uh I mean not so much that
00:57:15 - 00:57:18: but just more just like I just I I'm
00:57:17 - 00:57:20: thinking about it's all I talk about and
00:57:18 - 00:57:21: all I think about in my entire life and
00:57:20 - 00:57:23: I'm just kind of like I don't need to

00:57:23 - 00:57:27: mean um and once it's over once you see
00:57:26 - 00:57:28: I also just feel like the more I talk
00:57:27 - 00:57:30: about it like I'm trying something
00:57:28 - 00:57:31: different with this than anything I've
00:57:30 - 00:57:33: ever done in my life I have the biggest
00:57:31 - 00:57:34: mouth I want everybody to know the cool
00:57:33 - 00:57:36: things I'm working on and how cool it is
00:57:34 - 00:57:38: and all this stuff so it's like I can't
00:57:36 - 00:57:41: keep secrets like that this is easily
00:57:38 - 00:57:43: the biggest the most Secrets I've ever
00:57:41 - 00:57:45: kept about a project I'm working on from
00:57:43 - 00:57:46: people and like not like I'm not trying
00:57:45 - 00:57:47: to hype this up as if there's like a
00:57:46 - 00:57:49: million surprises or stuff it's
00:57:47 - 00:57:51: literally just I just want the whole I
00:57:49 - 00:57:53: want people to enjoy this you know does
00:57:51 - 00:57:54: the thing like in Hunger Games where
00:57:53 - 00:57:56: like it's one dress but then they set
00:57:54 - 00:57:58: fire to it and it's another dress oh
00:57:56 - 00:58:00: super cool like cosplay competitions
00:57:58 - 00:58:01: where they do one thing like I mean what
00:58:00 - 00:58:02: is a bummer is the amount of things that
00:58:01 - 00:58:04: I want to do that aren't just going to
00:58:02 - 00:58:06: work out you but overall hey there's
00:58:04 - 00:58:08: always a chance another marriage there
00:58:06 - 00:58:10: always is there always is I don't think
00:58:08 - 00:58:12: I'd go this hard for it but um 10 year
