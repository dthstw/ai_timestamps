00:13:22 - 00:13:25: back to the truth then yeah let's get
00:13:24 - 00:13:27: back to the truth and again I'm
00:13:25 - 00:13:28: derailing on Funnies and sillies and
00:13:27 - 00:13:30: that's this isn't my place you're doing
00:13:28 - 00:13:31: great right no I want to apologize
00:13:30 - 00:13:35: you're doing well tonight go ahead all
00:13:31 - 00:13:37: right so um first of all the two or
00:13:35 - 00:13:40: three that I have mentioned are ones
00:13:37 - 00:13:43: that hit on me first okay right so they
00:13:40 - 00:13:44: hit on me first and then I go and I go
00:13:43 - 00:13:46: and I look I always look at their
00:13:44 - 00:13:48: profile to see like what they do for a
00:13:46 - 00:13:51: living or maybe just to get a gist of
00:13:48 - 00:13:53: just general lifestyle or whatnot right
00:13:51 - 00:13:54: and so then you know I not as if like I
00:13:53 - 00:13:58: go you
00:13:54 - 00:14:00: know they they also on Rya they like me
00:13:58 - 00:14:02: first cuz every time I like somebody
00:14:00 - 00:14:03: they never like me back so I just kind
00:14:02 - 00:14:05: of wait until they like me first and
00:14:03 - 00:14:07: then I like them back so my point is
00:14:05 - 00:14:10: being is is that they and I'm ra and my
00:14:07 - 00:14:13: name my it's the biggest [ __ ] font on
00:14:10 - 00:14:14: the [ __ ] thing your your age right so
00:14:13 - 00:14:16: it's like so they know they don't they
00:14:14 - 00:14:19: know it's just after the second or third
00:14:16 - 00:14:21: date then they go um yeah you're too old
00:14:19 - 00:14:23: and I'm like and I'm go ahead I think I
00:14:21 - 00:14:26: know why they it they wait till the
00:14:23 - 00:14:28: third day it's cuz he starts getting mad
00:14:26 - 00:14:31: with they don't know 1950s references
00:14:28 - 00:14:33: and he starts yelling at them and then
00:14:31 - 00:14:36: they're probably like okay like I cannot
00:14:33 - 00:14:38: keep up with his kurasawa references
00:14:36 - 00:14:41: like I'm out you're too old when he came
00:14:38 - 00:14:43: on our podcast it was Vietnam this and

00:18:22 - 00:18:27: if they had had a baby there would be no
00:18:24 - 00:18:30: theovon in fact I think you get a
00:18:27 - 00:18:31: theovon when you have old old sperm and
00:18:30 - 00:18:33: young it's like you know what I mean
00:18:31 - 00:18:36: it's like a [ __ ] chemistry class but
00:18:33 - 00:18:39: as someone who comes from you too I know
00:18:36 - 00:18:42: my parents had a 36 year age Gap [ __ ]
00:18:39 - 00:18:44: creepy like when you're a child you
00:18:42 - 00:18:46: would not exist without that comination
00:18:44 - 00:18:48: I understand that but there was a very
00:18:46 - 00:18:52: conscious discomfort I felt when I
00:18:48 - 00:18:55: looked at my dad and my mom together and
00:18:52 - 00:18:57: I I could I understood like the age like
00:18:55 - 00:18:59: disparity very very young I I just have
00:18:57 - 00:19:03: a just a simple question when did when
00:18:59 - 00:19:07: did they meet so he was in his late 50s
00:19:03 - 00:19:09: I think he was 56 and she was early 20
00:19:07 - 00:19:11: 36 year age he was 57 she was 22 I
00:19:09 - 00:19:12: thought you were going to throw 12 at me
00:19:11 - 00:19:14: and I was like I was like these arranged
00:19:12 - 00:19:17: marriages get weird but all right you
00:19:14 - 00:19:19: know and it was um yeah like I got I I'm
00:19:17 - 00:19:21: I am creeped out by it even though I
00:19:19 - 00:19:24: love my dad I love my mom like it's just
00:19:21 - 00:19:26: are they still attending the really dead
00:19:24 - 00:19:28: no he's not attending super super dead
00:19:26 - 00:19:30: he would have been 100 this year in
00:19:28 - 00:19:33: August yeah yeah and um yeah what I'm
00:19:30 - 00:19:36: saying though though chemistry-wise it's
00:19:33 - 00:19:38: happened throughout the history of time
00:19:36 - 00:19:40: and and I want to say you're one of the

00:31:05 - 00:31:11: through she likeability his
00:31:08 - 00:31:12: likeability I think he breaks them down
00:31:11 - 00:31:14: I think he gets them when they're
00:31:12 - 00:31:16: vulnerable right so he'll find them
00:31:14 - 00:31:18: right after a breakup or like at the end

00:31:21 - 00:31:25: safe space you can tell me what you

00:31:47 - 00:31:52: put that in there but my point is is
00:31:48 - 00:31:54: that he looked like um he was unhinged
00:31:52 - 00:31:56: almost yeah yeah yeah yeah no he'll take
00:31:54 - 00:31:57: any opportunity he can with the women

00:31:57 - 00:32:02: what he's rolling with then you know I
00:32:00 - 00:32:04: feel like you guys have risen since I

00:32:04 - 00:32:08: is the podcast more popular it's been
00:32:06 - 00:32:10: doing okay as of recent I think it's on
00:32:08 - 00:32:13: a downward trajectory as of now all
00:32:10 - 00:32:15: podcasts are honest yeah yeah and also
00:32:13 - 00:32:18: you know we have an old saying here what
00:32:15 - 00:32:20: is it just stop no no we have an old
00:32:18 - 00:32:23: saying here what is it see that's what
00:32:20 - 00:32:25: he look like see that see that one I
00:32:23 - 00:32:28: that's so different yeah that's who I
00:32:25 - 00:32:31: met yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah to that
00:32:28 - 00:32:33: see what happened success he grew yeah
00:32:31 - 00:32:36: he's like I'm going to eat more meat or
00:32:33 - 00:32:38: whatever I think also he just it seems
00:32:36 - 00:32:40: like he just grew into his manliness
00:32:38 - 00:32:42: yeah cuz he looks like a boy in that
00:32:40 - 00:32:44: picture and he's all tooth right there
00:32:42 - 00:32:46: look at that yeah yeah yeah that is that
00:32:44 - 00:32:50: is something that we do bring up a lot U
00:32:46 - 00:32:51: we do call him Bailey Beaver yeah
00:32:50 - 00:32:53: because of his last name but we don't
00:32:51 - 00:32:56: mean it it's if you have large teeth
00:32:53 - 00:33:00: like that I would strongly recommend M
00:32:56 - 00:33:02: you whiten them they are white no they
00:33:00 - 00:33:04: have a yellow Hue maybe it's a shirt but
00:33:02 - 00:33:07: can I say something if if I see a guy
00:33:04 - 00:33:09: with impeccable like veneers that are
00:33:07 - 00:33:10: too white it's an ick it's not an ick
00:33:09 - 00:33:12: for me it's an absolute ick for it's a
00:33:10 - 00:33:14: win for me no I need some character I
00:33:12 - 00:33:16: need a little bit of a gap and a little
00:33:14 - 00:33:18: meit of jagged tooth maybe one a little
00:33:16 - 00:33:20: bit of crowding on the bottom so cute

00:35:09 - 00:35:11: were looking around as do you guys
00:35:10 - 00:35:14: oppose that sense yeah is that like a
00:35:11 - 00:35:17: revelation I agree yeah I think you're
00:35:14 - 00:35:19: right what what's the move though here's
00:35:17 - 00:35:23: what I right now I'm learning different
00:35:19 - 00:35:26: things and this is the truth so um one
00:35:23 - 00:35:28: of the signs that I see is a so let's
00:35:26 - 00:35:32: say we're at dinner put your arms on the
00:35:28 - 00:35:34: table right this is the first date and
00:35:32 - 00:35:36: um if somebody's doing this like if I
00:35:34 - 00:35:39: make a joke cuz I'm very
00:35:36 - 00:35:43: funny uh yeah if they do that like if I
00:35:39 - 00:35:46: go yeah and that's what the Jew is a
00:35:43 - 00:35:48: Calabasas I don't know let me get I hate
00:35:46 - 00:35:50: that punch line you I mean yeah that's
00:35:48 - 00:35:52: what the ringworm
00:35:50 - 00:35:56: said no don't do that yeah yeah so it
00:35:52 - 00:35:59: laugh so laugh that's what the ring word
00:35:56 - 00:36:01: said like that if that's no you're doing
00:35:59 - 00:36:03: it wrong yeah well I wasn't yeah yeah
00:36:01 - 00:36:06: yeah your eyes doesn't seem like you
00:36:03 - 00:36:08: want to be here well
00:36:06 - 00:36:10: brother is that how you handle it like
00:36:08 - 00:36:13: the girls like your eyes don't look like
00:36:10 - 00:36:15: you want to be here no no no so um with
00:36:13 - 00:36:17: their touching you right that that's a
00:36:15 - 00:36:20: good sign yeah but if they're not there
00:36:17 - 00:36:22: if there's no any kind of physical touch
00:36:20 - 00:36:25: that means there's no interest at all
00:36:22 - 00:36:27: that's what I realized it's mathematics
00:36:25 - 00:36:29: there are people or there are men who do
00:36:27 - 00:36:31: not read social cues like at all who
00:36:29 - 00:36:33: will still go in for the kiss and it's
00:36:31 - 00:36:35: so [ __ ] awkward where you're like
00:36:33 - 00:36:37: basically pulling away the whole and
00:36:35 - 00:36:40: they still think that you know the good
00:36:37 - 00:36:41: night kiss or the goodbye kiss is you
00:36:40 - 00:36:45: know right around the corner it's so
00:36:41 - 00:36:47: humiliating what do you say I I dodge
00:36:45 - 00:36:49: you dodge oh yeah I have no problem
00:36:47 - 00:36:51: saying no yeah like at this age maybe
00:36:49 - 00:36:52: when I was younger I would have dove in
00:36:51 - 00:36:54: but I got denied from a kiss recently

00:36:54 - 00:37:01: wrong so I I took this lovely BR uh to I

00:41:32 - 00:41:36: and it was it was a no but that's not
00:41:34 - 00:41:38: that didn't read as awkward we did end
00:41:36 - 00:41:42: up kissing later on a later date but it
00:41:38 - 00:41:42: was just that time that was that was
00:41:43 - 00:41:49: odd say it no I want talk about you know

00:48:16 - 00:48:20: time in Guam he spent a lot of time in

00:48:20 - 00:48:26: asian siblings I

00:48:34 - 00:48:39: taking a back seat in your life yeah I
00:48:37 - 00:48:43: uh okay so I have a urinar shoe and I I
00:48:39 - 00:48:47: used to I know Hey listen I used
00:48:43 - 00:48:49: to I used to pee I used to pee 10 to 12
00:48:47 - 00:48:51: times during the night oh oh you oh
00:48:49 - 00:48:53: attract infection no no no they it
00:48:51 - 00:48:55: wasn't that it was just I guess my
00:48:53 - 00:48:57: bladder really doesn't matter that was
00:48:55 - 00:48:59: the end result um and then they started
00:48:57 - 00:49:00: to give me these pills and apparently
00:48:59 - 00:49:02: delayed ejaculation so I could be having
00:49:00 - 00:49:05: sex for an hour hour and a half nothing
00:49:02 - 00:49:07: happens yeah oh can't even masturbate
00:49:05 - 00:49:09: anymore what's causing the frequent
00:49:07 - 00:49:11: urination though just like uh so
00:49:09 - 00:49:14: apparently people's muscles contract at
00:49:11 - 00:49:16: 150 milliters and mine do 150 milliters
00:49:14 - 00:49:18: um I went in and an elderly woman in her
00:49:16 - 00:49:19: 80s held my penis and put a catheter in
00:49:18 - 00:49:21: there and filled it up and they
00:49:19 - 00:49:23: decreased it I would rather T tear my
00:49:21 - 00:49:26: ACL again than go through that crazy so
00:49:23 - 00:49:28: basically because it's a reflex right
00:49:26 - 00:49:29: the brain to the bladder so you're
00:49:28 - 00:49:32: saying it sends a signal to your brain a
00:49:29 - 00:49:34: little too soon when only like half of
00:49:32 - 00:49:38: the bladder is full or even I mean I've
00:49:34 - 00:49:40: got I've went to go um liquid came back
00:49:38 - 00:49:41: laid down had to get right back up again
00:49:40 - 00:49:42: and it's like a full stream we're not
00:49:41 - 00:49:44: sitting there with dribbles and it's not
00:49:42 - 00:49:47: like anxiety related cuz like when I'm
00:49:44 - 00:49:49: super anxious I can usually like I I
00:49:47 - 00:49:51: have to pee like every hour but it's
00:49:49 - 00:49:52: more of like an obsessive thing yeah
00:49:51 - 00:49:54: it's not even it's something I don't
00:49:52 - 00:49:55: want to do but uh yeah it just comes out
00:49:54 - 00:49:57: and it's like I can't fall asleep
00:49:55 - 00:50:01: because I have this urge to not pee the

00:50:07 - 00:50:10: going on but it's the good stuff when
00:50:09 - 00:50:12: you weigh it
00:50:10 - 00:50:14: out when you weigh it out in your head
00:50:12 - 00:50:16: it's more important that you are not

00:52:35 - 00:52:40: I mean do you run into that or
00:52:37 - 00:52:43: no yeah I mean somewhat I mean I think
00:52:40 - 00:52:44: we have a pretty good cast in that
00:52:43 - 00:52:46: everyone's kind of doing something and
00:52:44 - 00:52:49: then I think I'm similar to you in the
00:52:46 - 00:52:50: sense of I my brain kind of goes just
00:52:49 - 00:52:53: off the rocker and I kind of have to
00:52:50 - 00:52:56: spread everything out um and I don't
00:52:53 - 00:52:58: know I make fun of and bring people
00:52:56 - 00:53:00: together do all that fun stuff um to
00:52:58 - 00:53:01: keep it exciting and moving but yeah I I
00:53:00 - 00:53:02: know what you mean but when you have to
00:53:01 - 00:53:04: carry it and it keep on going and then
00:53:02 - 00:53:05: you so I mean sometimes yeah we just
00:53:04 - 00:53:07: pause it and sit there and just kind of
00:53:05 - 00:53:08: all look at each other this is the worst
00:53:07 - 00:53:10: thing we've ever made in our entire life

00:57:27 - 00:57:31: other time was an Nickelodean Resort a
00:57:28 - 00:57:32: little weirder but it was fine yeah yeah
00:57:31 - 00:57:35: and then and then an edible why wouldn't
00:57:32 - 00:57:36: you take that it's legal it just doesn't
00:57:35 - 00:57:38: interest me I guess in the same way if
00:57:36 - 00:57:39: someone doesn't like Diet Coke they're
00:57:38 - 00:57:41: just like hey I'm not even thinking
00:57:39 - 00:57:43: about Diet Coke somebody would have to
00:57:41 - 00:57:45: try diet coke before they had an opinion
00:57:43 - 00:57:47: no yeah I guess I don't know I guess it
00:57:45 - 00:57:50: just never interest me I know but one
00:57:47 - 00:57:52: time just for interest St do it okay
00:57:50 - 00:57:54: fine yeah in fact the next time you come
00:57:52 - 00:57:56: on don't do it until you come back here
00:57:54 - 00:57:57: okay 3 years I'll be here no no no in
00:57:56 - 00:58:00: fact do you have any anals now wait

00:58:19 - 00:58:23: that's so interesting to me wow but it's
00:58:21 - 00:58:25: like also like she shouldn't and I think
00:58:23 - 00:58:27: that she'd probably go off the deep end
00:58:25 - 00:58:28: if she did was apparently I was getting
00:58:27 - 00:58:31: like
00:58:28 - 00:58:32: hyper consenti I don't know why any any
00:58:31 - 00:58:34: girl that I was with I accidentally like
00:58:32 - 00:58:36: would touch her shoulder I'm like I hope

01:01:10 - 01:01:15: that so I do logic movie in Portland yes
01:01:13 - 01:01:16: and the reason why I did it is because
01:01:15 - 01:01:20: they were like Kevin Smith is like
01:01:16 - 01:01:22: shadowing him okay so I go well if if
01:01:20 - 01:01:25: it's logic's first movie I mean he's
01:01:22 - 01:01:28: going to get notes from the master right
01:01:25 - 01:01:29: Kevin Smith so I'll do it so I show up
01:01:28 - 01:01:33: and then I was supposed to be the main
01:01:29 - 01:01:35: bad guy so it's like a Wednesday but I
01:01:33 - 01:01:36: have a I'm a little sick right and I
01:01:35 - 01:01:38: don't I'm like in my mind I'm like
01:01:36 - 01:01:39: should I tell them or not so I go you
01:01:38 - 01:01:42: know I'm going to tell them so they had
01:01:39 - 01:01:45: a doctor come over to my hotel and she
01:01:42 - 01:01:47: checked me out and then an hour later
01:01:45 - 01:01:48: logic calls me and goes yeah you can't
01:01:47 - 01:01:51: show up
01:01:48 - 01:01:53: here so what do I do they're like I'm
01:01:51 - 01:01:55: going to give the road to somebody else
01:01:53 - 01:01:57: I'm in the middle of the I go oh I'm
01:01:55 - 01:02:00: just going to go then no he goes I got
01:01:57 - 01:02:03: something else I want you to do so wait
01:02:00 - 01:02:05: 3 days so I waited a couple days like
01:02:03 - 01:02:06: two or 3 days in Portland you know what
01:02:05 - 01:02:10: I mean so I just shopping you know mean
01:02:06 - 01:02:13: I ate some meals and then um I finally
01:02:10 - 01:02:15: show up and I'm like they put me in like
01:02:13 - 01:02:18: this kind of you know a tracksuit and I
01:02:15 - 01:02:21: do this improvised scene there's no
01:02:18 - 01:02:23: [ __ ] Kevin Smith to be found around
01:02:21 - 01:02:25: right which is fine so I'm out there and
01:02:23 - 01:02:27: then you know I run into the the Devil
01:02:25 - 01:02:30: Himself all over tree you know what I
01:02:27 - 01:02:32: mean you know Oliver tree not personally
01:02:30 - 01:02:34: I'm sitting there next to him and then
01:02:32 - 01:02:36: like um we do this improvised scene with
01:02:34 - 01:02:38: logic's Dad uh and you know you know how
01:02:36 - 01:02:41: sometimes like when okay when you're
01:02:38 - 01:02:43: improvising in a movie right this is it
01:02:41 - 01:02:46: works if everyone's listening to each
01:02:43 - 01:02:48: other right so it's just like you know I
01:02:46 - 01:02:50: mean I would say something so it's it's
01:02:48 - 01:02:52: me logic his dad and there's somebody
01:02:50 - 01:02:54: else and I go um I would say they go
01:02:52 - 01:02:56: action I go yeah man but my age you know
01:02:54 - 01:02:59: what I mean and then logic's dad would
01:02:56 - 01:03:01: be like I love grapefruits and and and
01:02:59 - 01:03:04: then logic would be like hey man look at
01:03:01 - 01:03:05: the sky I mean like no one's listening
01:03:04 - 01:03:08: to each other and so what that's what
01:03:05 - 01:03:10: the whole scene's like okay so my mind I

01:04:27 - 01:04:31: something yeah and if I just tell the
01:04:30 - 01:04:34: story outright right there's no
01:04:31 - 01:04:35: narrative's no Nar already where I

01:05:09 - 01:05:13: all that stuff was you know I mean kind
01:05:11 - 01:05:15: of Tru but okay so this is what happened

01:06:22 - 01:06:28: announced one but I had I was already

01:06:52 - 01:06:57: have led with that hey thank goodness we
01:06:54 - 01:07:01: cleared that up so he had a friend with
01:06:57 - 01:07:03: him yes okay okay okay also Bobby would
01:07:01 - 01:07:05: never tap someone on the shoulder and
01:07:03 - 01:07:07: say excuse me you're right you're right
01:07:05 - 01:07:08: confront anyone in that way that's the
01:07:07 - 01:07:10: part that threw me and I don't know you
01:07:08 - 01:07:12: super well I I didn't think you were
01:07:10 - 01:07:14: going to get into the
01:07:12 - 01:07:15: battle Yeah it's like when I you know
01:07:14 - 01:07:18: when I went to rehab and I was they
01:07:15 - 01:07:19: would tell me ask me stuff like tell me
01:07:18 - 01:07:22: about this and once I would start they
01:07:19 - 01:07:24: would stop they would go stop we just
01:07:22 - 01:07:26: want no humor or any exaggeration we
01:07:24 - 01:07:28: just want the truth
01:07:26 - 01:07:30: and you know what I didn't do that here
01:07:28 - 01:07:32: and but that was the truth now let me
01:07:30 - 01:07:35: ask you guys something what story was
01:07:32 - 01:07:36: better uh the first one I loved a
01:07:35 - 01:07:38: collection of you backtracking and
01:07:36 - 01:07:40: telling the full thing I think that add
01:07:38 - 01:07:41: scope that where we didn't don't have to
01:07:40 - 01:07:42: cut it out now no we're not going to cut
01:07:41 - 01:07:45: out the first yeah we're keeping it all
01:07:42 - 01:07:47: in God I'm in now yeah yeah if I was
01:07:45 - 01:07:48: told just one of the stories I would
01:07:47 - 01:07:50: have I would have looked at you and hey
01:07:48 - 01:07:51: Bob maybe it's time to hang up the old
01:07:50 - 01:07:53: microphone but
01:07:51 - 01:07:56: now yeah yeah yeah but now that we got
01:07:53 - 01:07:58: both stories and you intertwined it
01:07:56 - 01:08:00: it's good it's a whole piece right so
01:07:58 - 01:08:03: but but so my instinct is right the
01:08:00 - 01:08:06: first door is better more drama more
01:08:03 - 01:08:10: drama but if I told the second if I tell
01:08:06 - 01:08:13: things as is it's not great yeah but you
01:08:10 - 01:08:14: got to tell things as is in real life do
01:08:13 - 01:08:17: you do that or do you find a hard time
01:08:14 - 01:08:19: okay you're right he embellishes in real
01:08:17 - 01:08:21: life even and it's so hard to kind of
01:08:19 - 01:08:23: figure out like what you're right you're
01:08:21 - 01:08:25: right you're right so unless you're
01:08:23 - 01:08:27: there you don't know if what he's saying
01:08:25 - 01:08:30: is 100% well if he's telling me a story
01:08:27 - 01:08:34: because I know him so well I I know
01:08:30 - 01:08:36: which pieces he's likely exaggerating so
01:08:34 - 01:08:38: I will recreate a version of that story
01:08:36 - 01:08:40: in my own mind this I know this is what
01:08:38 - 01:08:42: really happened but he needs to tell it
01:08:40 - 01:08:43: this way it's like okay you went to you
01:08:42 - 01:08:45: went to Walmart to get some apples but
01:08:43 - 01:08:48: Trump wasn't there like you have to take
01:08:45 - 01:08:50: I had to delete like characters from the
01:08:48 - 01:08:51: story and then like okay this was the TR
01:08:50 - 01:08:53: The Princess Bride wasn't being
01:08:51 - 01:08:55: reenacted like it was yeah yeah yeah
01:08:53 - 01:08:57: very good reference what happened to
01:08:55 - 01:08:59: Carrie Elis killing it what are you
01:08:57 - 01:09:00: talking about he's in everything is he
01:08:59 - 01:09:02: in everything now yeah yeah yeah he's
01:09:00 - 01:09:04: always been every everything I know I
01:09:02 - 01:09:05: just had such a crush when I was young
01:09:04 - 01:09:08: here's the thing about Carri elways
01:09:05 - 01:09:10: right is and in in in in the state of
01:09:08 - 01:09:12: television and film there's just so much
01:09:10 - 01:09:14: out there there's so many streaming
01:09:12 - 01:09:16: platforms that just there's no way to
01:09:14 - 01:09:18: know what people are doing unless
01:09:16 - 01:09:20: they're in a gigantic thing like Planet
01:09:18 - 01:09:22: of the Apes or you know mean the new
01:09:20 - 01:09:25: Ghostbusters if they're in huge
01:09:22 - 01:09:26: Hollywood Productions right yeah so why
01:09:25 - 01:09:28: didn't you and your rap pack ever get
01:09:26 - 01:09:31: together and make a
01:09:28 - 01:09:32: movie like all the podcasters that are
01:09:31 - 01:09:35: obviously well I mean you know um Shane
01:09:32 - 01:09:36: and Andrew they did tires and and then
01:09:35 - 01:09:39: me and you know Andrew are doing some
01:09:36 - 01:09:41: things but you're right I think that um
01:09:39 - 01:09:42: you can almost have an anti- Avenger
01:09:41 - 01:09:44: Avengers of you know superheroes with
01:09:42 - 01:09:46: terrible powers that come together so
01:09:44 - 01:09:49: tomorrow what I'm doing is um I don't
01:09:46 - 01:09:52: just I don't want Holly I'm bit stupid

01:09:52 - 01:09:57: friend a couple like producer guy writer

01:12:31 - 01:12:36: I'm going to add now one of our my
01:12:34 - 01:12:38: biggest qualms in the relationship is
01:12:36 - 01:12:40: that he would only say I love you when
01:12:38 - 01:12:43: he wanted me to either shut up or get
01:12:40 - 01:12:45: out of a situation you want me to leave
01:12:43 - 01:12:48: he wants it to be over the reality of it
01:12:45 - 01:12:51: is um it's going to hurt then that's
01:12:48 - 01:12:51: completely
01:12:51 - 01:12:56: fine you don't want me to no go ahead
01:12:53 - 01:12:59: just all right so it's gonna hurt I
01:12:56 - 01:13:00: thought you were someone else no I
01:12:59 - 01:13:02: thought you were those money guys that I
01:13:00 - 01:13:05: did what's that money podcast I did Ram
01:13:02 - 01:13:07: Stefan yeah those guys the financial
01:13:05 - 01:13:10: Channel up until for some reason I
01:13:07 - 01:13:11: thought up until like right now no up
01:13:10 - 01:13:13: until I thought we were going to do the
01:13:11 - 01:13:16: podcast I literally would thought it was
01:13:13 - 01:13:19: them until I saw you walk up I go oh
01:13:16 - 01:13:21: yeah right in my mind you thought you
01:13:19 - 01:13:23: were this guy yeah that guy really the
01:13:21 - 01:13:26: same no I thought that that's that's he

01:13:26 - 01:13:30: you walked up and I go oh [ __ ] I love
01:13:28 - 01:13:31: this guy Zach right is that the truth

01:13:31 - 01:13:36: okay yeah yeah that's the truth right
01:13:33 - 01:13:38: and so so before you sat down I
01:13:36 - 01:13:39: remember we talk you know how I went to
01:13:38 - 01:13:41: the bathroom I didn't have to go to the
01:13:39 - 01:13:43: bathroom you s you search I kind of
01:13:41 - 01:13:44: Googled you and stuff and looked to see
01:13:43 - 01:13:47: you know what I
01:13:44 - 01:13:48: mean you said we want the truth we want
01:13:47 - 01:13:52: the truth yes this is good this is good
01:13:48 - 01:13:55: P so here's the another truth then
01:13:52 - 01:13:57: um I do love you and and and I love you
01:13:55 - 01:13:59: in this way I even when I did your
01:13:57 - 01:14:01: podcast a year ago or whatever I
01:13:59 - 01:14:03: remembered you and I remember walking
01:14:01 - 01:14:06: away like that guy's crazy I I like that
01:14:03 - 01:14:08: guy right and I always always have so so
01:14:06 - 01:14:10: as a podcaster and stuff I do love you
01:14:08 - 01:14:12: now as a person I don't know you that
01:14:10 - 01:14:16: well yeah so now is did is the truth
01:14:12 - 01:14:19: hurt or is that better that's way better
01:14:16 - 01:14:20: yeah that's way better how have you felt
01:14:19 - 01:14:23: this
01:14:20 - 01:14:25: time with me has gone like if you're
01:14:23 - 01:14:27: being honest like all right I'm you want
01:14:25 - 01:14:29: to play the game let's play the game you
01:14:27 - 01:14:31: know I'm being fully honest right honest
01:14:29 - 01:14:33: I mean okay so the thing that I've been
01:14:31 - 01:14:35: the things that I've been thinking about
01:14:33 - 01:14:36: this whole podcast is wow there's so
01:14:35 - 01:14:39: many
01:14:36 - 01:14:41: similarities in the way you do things
01:14:39 - 01:14:43: right and it's almost it's almost hard
01:14:41 - 01:14:46: for me to do podcast with somebody
01:14:43 - 01:14:48: that's like me because you need somebody
01:14:46 - 01:14:50: that's a little bit more like grounded
01:14:48 - 01:14:53: and you know what I mean insane almost
01:14:50 - 01:14:55: right so I think we're both in the way
01:14:53 - 01:14:57: on our individual podcast where we come
01:14:55 - 01:14:59: out of left field and like and we're
01:14:57 - 01:15:00: trying to take over in such a way where
01:14:59 - 01:15:02: it's like I bet nobody's ever heard that
01:15:00 - 01:15:04: before so then I had then there were
01:15:02 - 01:15:07: moments in this P podcast where I've had
01:15:04 - 01:15:09: to like just back out and just
01:15:07 - 01:15:10: completely detach that's what I've tried
01:15:09 - 01:15:12: to do because I noticed we were both
01:15:10 - 01:15:14: trying to do it and I thought you I was
01:15:12 - 01:15:17: like this is his show I can't go crazy I
01:15:14 - 01:15:19: got to be the straight man here okay so
01:15:17 - 01:15:22: that's literally the truth okay love
01:15:19 - 01:15:23: this fourth wall stuff but I also I yeah
01:15:22 - 01:15:25: I mean I don't think no one wants to
01:15:23 - 01:15:26: listen to it no no I love it I'm being I
01:15:25 - 01:15:28: know but people listening in the [ __ ]
01:15:26 - 01:15:31: out in the world maybe yeah they do so
01:15:28 - 01:15:33: at that's the real truth of it all so
01:15:31 - 01:15:35: you know you take it with the way but I
01:15:33 - 01:15:37: do I like you I do do I love you as a
01:15:35 - 01:15:39: person if you died I'd be super sad no
01:15:37 - 01:15:41: you wouldn't no I would be sad but I
01:15:39 - 01:15:43: wouldn't cry but it wouldn't like show
01:15:41 - 01:15:44: like it' take you days to figure it out
01:15:43 - 01:15:46: like nobody would call you soon no I
01:15:44 - 01:15:48: would no oh immediately these guys would
01:15:46 - 01:15:50: call like oh yeah Z that money guy from

01:21:05 - 01:21:09: you're diverting you're dividing your
01:21:07 - 01:21:11: anger because I could get an answer from
01:21:09 - 01:21:14: you somebody emailed you called me
01:21:11 - 01:21:17: personally you called me personally and
01:21:14 - 01:21:21: you told me on the phone that this
01:21:17 - 01:21:23: person J Moore can't do it it's that's
01:21:21 - 01:21:24: all the information I need to hear so is
01:21:23 - 01:21:26: but three previous texts to you it
01:21:24 - 01:21:28: doesn't matter I didn't get an answer
01:21:26 - 01:21:31: for how how then how are you calling me
01:21:28 - 01:21:32: then by you calling me and saying Jay
01:21:31 - 01:21:35: can't do it how do you know that
01:21:32 - 01:21:38: information because after okay um here
01:21:35 - 01:21:40: let me calm down because after I didn't
01:21:38 - 01:21:42: get an answer from you in three text
01:21:40 - 01:21:44: messages I got an email from somebody
01:21:42 - 01:21:46: that said J Moore and like three other
01:21:44 - 01:21:48: people in how how does that person know
01:21:46 - 01:21:51: that Jay's even doing the podcast when
01:21:48 - 01:21:54: only me Kila and you know that Jay's do
01:21:51 - 01:21:57: how does George know that that person
01:21:54 - 01:21:58: rivy to that information how do I know J
01:21:57 - 01:22:00: Moore is doing the podcast if you don't
01:21:58 - 01:22:03: tell me I did tell you because you
01:22:00 - 01:22:04: called me and said that J can't do it do
01:22:03 - 01:22:06: you think okay you never told me he
01:22:04 - 01:22:09: could do it a certain you just you you
01:22:06 - 01:22:12: called me and you say Jay can't do the
01:22:09 - 01:22:14: date we have to find someone else is you
01:22:12 - 01:22:17: knowing that it it it's happening this
01:22:14 - 01:22:17: is a fundamental error
01:22:17 - 01:22:20: Theory you know I want to go to this guy
01:22:19 - 01:22:23: what do you think I just have a couple
01:22:20 - 01:22:26: questions yeah go ahead back up back sit
01:22:23 - 01:22:27: down sit down is is there is there a
01:22:26 - 01:22:29: publicist that's what we're trying to
01:22:27 - 01:22:32: figure out apparently not according to
01:22:29 - 01:22:34: Jay but we got George got an email from
01:22:32 - 01:22:36: a publicist so so you got an email from
01:22:34 - 01:22:38: someone saying he can't do these dates
01:22:36 - 01:22:39: correct I got an email from somebody no
01:22:38 - 01:22:42: here I got an email okay I texted Bobby
01:22:39 - 01:22:44: three times didn't get an answer that's
01:22:42 - 01:22:46: that's pointless to the [ __ ] thing
01:22:44 - 01:22:47: man hey he's also heard about it we have
01:22:46 - 01:22:49: to validate those feelings before we
01:22:47 - 01:22:51: move on yeah but that's pointless to the
01:22:49 - 01:22:53: thing he knows about it go ahead we
01:22:51 - 01:22:56: still got to answer him so then some a
01:22:53 - 01:22:58: public publicist emailed me with like
01:22:56 - 01:23:00: five names of probably doing some movie
01:22:58 - 01:23:03: promotion or something J Moore was one
01:23:00 - 01:23:05: of them I said hey we reached out to J
01:23:03 - 01:23:07: Mo U I already reached out to J Moore
01:23:05 - 01:23:09: about this state maybe you can help
01:23:07 - 01:23:12: facilitate they
01:23:09 - 01:23:15: responded oh looks like he can't do that
01:23:12 - 01:23:17: date uh maybe you like this other
01:23:15 - 01:23:18: person who's the other person who's the
01:23:17 - 01:23:20: other person who's the other person Adam
01:23:18 - 01:23:24: Corolla exactly
01:23:20 - 01:23:27: so now both J Moore so the only answer
01:23:24 - 01:23:28: four interactions about can Jay more do
01:23:27 - 01:23:31: this date was
01:23:28 - 01:23:33: no so so he was as a producer he's
01:23:31 - 01:23:35: trying to do his due diligence of hey
01:23:33 - 01:23:37: I'm not really getting this information
01:23:35 - 01:23:39: uh this guy he has the information okay
01:23:37 - 01:23:41: but he knows the information he knows
01:23:39 - 01:23:44: the date and he knows that Jay's doing
01:23:41 - 01:23:46: it right and then all of a sudden this
01:23:44 - 01:23:47: person that no one knows because you
01:23:46 - 01:23:49: told him he was already doing it that's
01:23:47 - 01:23:51: how he knows the information yeah okay
01:23:49 - 01:23:53: do you think that he maybe thought that
01:23:51 - 01:23:55: you maybe got it wrong why would he
01:23:53 - 01:23:56: didn't think that I think that and then
01:23:55 - 01:23:59: maybe he was just reconfirming and then
01:23:56 - 01:24:00: he hears from his people he thought
01:23:59 - 01:24:03: there's no
01:24:00 - 01:24:05: yes there's no response he never knew
01:24:03 - 01:24:07: Jay was doing it ever to any of these
01:24:05 - 01:24:09: that's my point Bobby there's no
01:24:07 - 01:24:11: response so I had to go around to try to
01:24:09 - 01:24:15: get information I had to try to
01:24:11 - 01:24:16: get I know but back up do this date no
