00:01:11 - 00:01:15: did you just go on pause then no we did
00:01:13 - 00:01:18: the worst thing ever but the people
00:01:15 - 00:01:21: loved it which was we complained about
00:01:18 - 00:01:23: not being able to survive in a studio
00:01:21 - 00:01:27: like this while people would send in 60c
00:01:23 - 00:01:28: sets via file and then they we would
00:01:27 - 00:01:31: Zoom with them to interview them
00:01:28 - 00:01:34: afterwards but way to make it happen it
00:01:31 - 00:01:36: was crazy but and so it was kind of like
00:01:34 - 00:01:38: everybody got to see how much we were
00:01:36 - 00:01:39: struggling and apply that to their own
00:01:38 - 00:01:41: struggles you know what I mean instead
00:01:39 - 00:01:44: of oh everybody else is just doing their
00:01:41 - 00:01:46: normal podcast I from what I gathered
00:01:44 - 00:01:49: afterwards and by the way at the time it
00:01:46 - 00:01:53: was the most [ __ ] depressed and in in
00:01:49 - 00:01:55: I was losing my mind in Los Angeles my
00:01:53 - 00:01:56: neighborhood was where the riots hit
00:01:55 - 00:01:59: where we were shooting our studio was at
00:01:56 - 00:02:01: LaBrea and sunset so there's literally
00:01:59 - 00:02:04: just Less encampments on fire that you
00:02:01 - 00:02:06: had to walk by to get into the studio
00:02:04 - 00:02:10: like the city was on fire yeah it was
00:02:06 - 00:02:12: crazy and um so no it was rough but like
00:02:10 - 00:02:14: it was relatably rough yeah because I'm
00:02:12 - 00:02:16: like this is not what we do this show
00:02:14 - 00:02:18: you're probably I mean I think when I
00:02:16 - 00:02:20: think about like all the I mean it's
00:02:18 - 00:02:22: Innovative it's a it's a very unique one
00:02:20 - 00:02:24: and only show but you also been the most
00:02:22 - 00:02:26: consistent person I think I don't feel
00:02:24 - 00:02:28: like you've missed a week we have not we
00:02:26 - 00:02:30: have put out an episode every single
00:02:28 - 00:02:32: Monday for 11 years
00:02:30 - 00:02:34: that's pretty incredible that's everyone
00:02:32 - 00:02:36: should know that 11 years yeah that's
00:02:34 - 00:02:38: pretty incredible 11 years doing a
00:02:36 - 00:02:40: podcast 11 years because I think a lot
00:02:38 - 00:02:42: of you know it's like I I I it's so
00:02:40 - 00:02:45: funny I had a kid
00:02:42 - 00:02:47: backstage uh I was in I don't know some
00:02:45 - 00:02:50: Arena and this kid's backstage these
00:02:47 - 00:02:52: college kids and uh they I know their
00:02:50 - 00:02:54: dad or something and I had just done an
00:02:52 - 00:02:56: arena and he's like dude you know what

00:03:06 - 00:03:11: him
00:03:07 - 00:03:16: yeah it's crazy it's crazy because it's
00:03:11 - 00:03:18: like uh it it's it it's I I feel
00:03:16 - 00:03:20: disconnected from Comedy quite often
00:03:18 - 00:03:22: because I feel like I do this thing that
00:03:20 - 00:03:24: I'm doing now which isn't really
00:03:22 - 00:03:26: adjacent to how we started you know it's
00:03:24 - 00:03:27: like it's it's fun it's big and it's
00:03:26 - 00:03:30: awesome I just ended my tour in in
00:03:27 - 00:03:31: Austin Saturday
00:03:30 - 00:03:33: and then we start up for fully loaded
00:03:31 - 00:03:36: this summer [ __ ] yeah we're gonna have a
00:03:33 - 00:03:38: [ __ ] blast and and but I went one
00:03:36 - 00:03:39: night I went to dinner to edvs with

00:03:41 - 00:03:46: hadn't done the show since it was in in
00:03:44 - 00:03:48: the store and I went and got on it and I
00:03:46 - 00:03:51: was I know this going to sound crazy to
00:03:48 - 00:03:54: people I was very funny like I and I
00:03:51 - 00:03:55: forgot you were I forgot I was funny and
00:03:54 - 00:03:58: you know what I'm going to be honest
00:03:55 - 00:04:01: with you it's been driving me crazy
00:03:58 - 00:04:03: hearing people talk [ __ ] sometimes once
00:04:01 - 00:04:07: in a while about you because I'm like
00:04:03 - 00:04:10: wait now maybe a little bit maybe a
00:04:07 - 00:04:11: touch before but late I swear I'm not
00:04:10 - 00:04:14: even kidding or especially kissing your
00:04:11 - 00:04:16: ass but you were so funny that episode
00:04:14 - 00:04:18: in the moment completely improvised and
00:04:16 - 00:04:21: it's hard for people people would be
00:04:18 - 00:04:24: shocked to know what comedians get there
00:04:21 - 00:04:25: and kind of stiffen up cuz I'm hosting
00:04:24 - 00:04:27: and they want to they want to kind of
00:04:25 - 00:04:29: host people want to host Oh you mean
00:04:27 - 00:04:31: like me instead of no you're great
00:04:29 - 00:04:33: instead of sitting back and just
00:04:31 - 00:04:35: cranking homers and picking their
00:04:33 - 00:04:36: moments and you were doing I've always
00:04:35 - 00:04:38: you know what I struggled with with your
00:04:36 - 00:04:39: show this is I told you this in the very
00:04:38 - 00:04:41: beginning I did it the I've done it a
00:04:39 - 00:04:43: number of times but the very first time
00:04:41 - 00:04:44: I was like so what what do we do and
00:04:43 - 00:04:46: you're like all these people come on
00:04:44 - 00:04:48: they do their sit and then like you know
00:04:46 - 00:04:51: I just [ __ ] rip them apart and I'm
00:04:48 - 00:04:54: like uh I was one of the I've seen a few
00:04:51 - 00:04:56: other people do this where like I always
00:04:54 - 00:04:58: try to go like here's here's what I
00:04:56 - 00:05:00: think you should do to get better at I
00:04:58 - 00:05:02: try to be like a that's great but it's
00:05:00 - 00:05:04: not funny like I actually just go like I
00:05:02 - 00:05:06: think you should that part is great
00:05:04 - 00:05:07: people think guests think that when they
00:05:06 - 00:05:10: come on oh it's a roast show I got to
00:05:07 - 00:05:11: make fun of people and I tell them like
00:05:10 - 00:05:13: when they go hey just let you know
00:05:11 - 00:05:16: roasting isn't really my thing I I go
00:05:13 - 00:05:17: great that's my thing yeah I do that
00:05:16 - 00:05:20: that's not what everybody's supposed to
00:05:17 - 00:05:23: do advice is great just being funny and
00:05:20 - 00:05:25: noticing things is the real role we did
00:05:23 - 00:05:29: your one your anniversary show Joe and I
00:05:25 - 00:05:31: did yeah the 10 year the tenure so fun
00:05:29 - 00:05:34: yeah I was a spectator at that and I was
00:05:31 - 00:05:37: enjoying myself cuz I was high yeah I
00:05:34 - 00:05:39: was drunk yeah and it was actually like
00:05:37 - 00:05:42: having a front row seat literally to
00:05:39 - 00:05:44: watch this oh yeah show take place that
00:05:42 - 00:05:46: was incredible it was so fun to be a
00:05:44 - 00:05:48: part of but I noticed that that's been
00:05:46 - 00:05:50: happening a lot at these big ones that
00:05:48 - 00:05:52: was like a big experiment for us to do
00:05:50 - 00:05:54: the bigger venues huge venue with a
00:05:52 - 00:05:56: bigger production and all this stuff how
00:05:54 - 00:05:58: does it change cuz I haven't seen one of
00:05:56 - 00:06:00: the Arena ones is it is it pretty much
00:05:58 - 00:06:04: the same thing just just larger scale
00:06:00 - 00:06:06: larger scale but I'm so ready and on
00:06:04 - 00:06:09: that it is kind of like you know I'm
00:06:06 - 00:06:12: like really driving the ship so I have
00:06:09 - 00:06:14: noticed that it is harder for the guests
00:06:12 - 00:06:16: to kind of pick their spots pick their
00:06:14 - 00:06:20: spot because I have enough time I'm not
00:06:16 - 00:06:22: used to a bonus 5 Seconds of laughter
00:06:20 - 00:06:24: reverberation and that 5 Seconds when
00:06:22 - 00:06:26: you're used to having to have your next
00:06:24 - 00:06:27: question or your next joke or whatever
00:06:26 - 00:06:29: that let you come up wherever you want
00:06:27 - 00:06:32: to steer the ship how much more intim
00:06:29 - 00:06:34: dating is it for these newbies to do an
00:06:32 - 00:06:36: arena possible everybody out of the
00:06:34 - 00:06:39: bucket is bombed on these things it have
00:06:36 - 00:06:42: to be it terrifying first time I did an
00:06:39 - 00:06:45: arena I was I was eight years in I was
00:06:42 - 00:06:46: opening for uh Russell Peters yeah and
00:06:45 - 00:06:49: he flew me over to
00:06:46 - 00:06:52: London first we did his he did a warm-up
00:06:49 - 00:06:55: show yeah for 7500 people in Birmingham
00:06:52 - 00:06:58: and then we go to do the O2 and I'm like
00:06:55 - 00:07:00: so I'm a I'm eight years into standup
00:06:58 - 00:07:02: terrifi
00:07:00 - 00:07:06: and that's with like a set that I know
00:07:02 - 00:07:08: I'm doing I can't imagine doing a cold
00:07:06 - 00:07:11: one minute there we have learned that
00:07:08 - 00:07:13: 100% of people out of the bucket bomb so
00:07:11 - 00:07:14: how do you how do you deal with that so
00:07:13 - 00:07:16: what I've been doing lately and it's
00:07:14 - 00:07:19: great that we've had these practice runs
00:07:16 - 00:07:20: before going to MSG is I stalk the
00:07:19 - 00:07:23: lineup by the way you're calling the
00:07:20 - 00:07:26: Forum a practice run yeah it is weird
00:07:23 - 00:07:28: God damn it sometimes I don't know how
00:07:26 - 00:07:31: [ __ ] cringy and ridiculous I sound I
00:07:28 - 00:07:34: hope it's but it's the truth is like MSG
00:07:31 - 00:07:36: is the [ __ ] I mean like I'm not I'm
00:07:34 - 00:07:38: probably never going to do MSG but the
00:07:36 - 00:07:41: forum for me was like a that's because I
00:07:38 - 00:07:42: live in LA still totally but it I mean I
00:07:41 - 00:07:44: know I think you did the for him twice
00:07:42 - 00:07:46: so like I mean so it's like it is a
00:07:44 - 00:07:48: practice run and the roast and I did the
00:07:46 - 00:07:51: Staple Center with Gillis and Schultz
00:07:48 - 00:07:53: how was that it was unbelievable I mean
00:07:51 - 00:07:56: like with Schultz Gillis post Malone and
00:07:53 - 00:07:58: Derek Poston who's my [ __ ] homie who
00:07:56 - 00:07:59: I originally hooked up with Schultz
00:07:58 - 00:08:02: Schultz a few years ago was like you got
00:07:59 - 00:08:03: an opener I could use for San ant black
00:08:02 - 00:08:05: guy I need a black guy well that's how I
00:08:03 - 00:08:06: that's how I translated he said an
00:08:05 - 00:08:08: opener that I could use in San Antonio
00:08:06 - 00:08:10: I'm like who's but oh boom it was like
00:08:08 - 00:08:13: immediate yeah because I knew David
00:08:10 - 00:08:14: Lucas was kind of more independ I don't
00:08:13 - 00:08:17: know how to describe it like he's more
00:08:14 - 00:08:20: like an independent creature yeah but
00:08:17 - 00:08:22: Derek is just such a fun hang and so
00:08:20 - 00:08:24: funny and he's a rising stock like crazy
00:08:22 - 00:08:27: I work with him four nights a week at
00:08:24 - 00:08:30: the Mother Ship he brings me up there
00:08:27 - 00:08:33: regularly so to get to do Staple Center
00:08:30 - 00:08:35: with Derek cold opening who who opens
00:08:33 - 00:08:37: almost all the shows at the mothership I
00:08:35 - 00:08:41: mean he's being built like [ __ ] Darth
00:08:37 - 00:08:43: Vader yeah and so for it to go him me
00:08:41 - 00:08:45: Gillis who is literally my favorite
00:08:43 - 00:08:48: [ __ ] drinking buddy him and I were
00:08:45 - 00:08:50: just at Texas stadium doing this [ __ ]

00:09:34 - 00:09:39: mind watching his standup like he's
00:09:37 - 00:09:43: talking about his actual life and having
00:09:39 - 00:09:47: his first kid and it's so much smarter
00:09:43 - 00:09:48: and I literally it made me feel like a
00:09:47 - 00:09:51: kind of a hack because I'm up there
00:09:48 - 00:09:53: talking about trans School shooters and
00:09:51 - 00:09:55: [ __ ] the sub that went down to the

00:09:55 - 00:09:59: reaching for anything in the world that
00:09:57 - 00:10:01: I find dark and funny and he's up there
00:09:59 - 00:10:03: talking about his actual life killing
00:10:01 - 00:10:05: and I'm cracking up to we're like holy

00:13:09 - 00:13:14: all that stuff but and we saw you at the
00:13:11 - 00:13:16: 5K but so how did when were you how were
00:13:14 - 00:13:19: you a late edition how did this crazy
00:13:16 - 00:13:20: crazy crazy story so like you know I
00:13:19 - 00:13:24: wrote for the last 10 Comedy Central
00:13:20 - 00:13:26: rast Comedy Central never gave me a shot
00:13:24 - 00:13:28: at all to get on them which was crazy
00:13:26 - 00:13:30: cuz if you remember Comedy Central was
00:13:28 - 00:13:33: literally making Stars at the time like
00:13:30 - 00:13:35: SNL used to way back in the day and and
00:13:33 - 00:13:37: the roasts were huge for a minute huge
00:13:35 - 00:13:40: and the roast before I started writing
00:13:37 - 00:13:41: on it the writers that were on the roast
00:13:40 - 00:13:43: before I started writing on it were
00:13:41 - 00:13:46: Whitney Cummings Anthony jzl neck da d d
00:13:43 - 00:13:48: d so there was a clear path yeah so on
00:13:46 - 00:13:50: the first roast I'm like okay so if I
00:13:48 - 00:13:53: kill it in this writer room and get a
00:13:50 - 00:13:56: ton of jokes in and really focus I can
00:13:53 - 00:14:01: get on the next one yeah 10 10 later
00:13:56 - 00:14:03: [ __ ] Trump boom bo uh [ __ ] rob low
00:14:01 - 00:14:06: Bruce Willis Alec Baldwin you name it
00:14:03 - 00:14:08: I'm like that close never got on one but
00:14:06 - 00:14:10: all that stuff there convers like would
00:14:08 - 00:14:11: would it be with um because for these
00:14:10 - 00:14:13: are usually conversations that happen
00:14:11 - 00:14:15: with like managers and a you know behind
00:14:13 - 00:14:17: the scenes they you tell your manager I
00:14:15 - 00:14:20: want to do this I had a bad manager for
00:14:17 - 00:14:22: a long time and I'm a very loyal loyal
00:14:20 - 00:14:23: dog so I'm like we're going to do it
00:14:22 - 00:14:25: together and I didn't realized it just
00:14:23 - 00:14:28: wasn't happening sure enough he retired
00:14:25 - 00:14:31: a month before the pandemic oh what a
00:14:28 - 00:14:33: what a move yeah exactly good timing on
00:14:31 - 00:14:34: his part oh my God it was unbelievable
00:14:33 - 00:14:36: makes you feel like he might be
00:14:34 - 00:14:38: connected with it yeah that I honestly
00:14:36 - 00:14:40: did I'm like what the [ __ ] cuz I was
00:14:38 - 00:14:42: left with in shambles so you never get
00:14:40 - 00:14:45: your shot and then never get my shot but
00:14:42 - 00:14:48: I'm super close with Jeff Ross who you
00:14:45 - 00:14:50: know I worked with directly on a lot of
00:14:48 - 00:14:52: those things he really does executive
00:14:50 - 00:14:54: produce all these things and knows how
00:14:52 - 00:14:56: to do it I told him I said without your
00:14:54 - 00:14:58: fingers in the pie it would have been a
00:14:56 - 00:15:01: nightmare I I I I gave him his flowers
00:14:58 - 00:15:03: that night and the next day and it like
00:15:01 - 00:15:05: every party I saw him because I think
00:15:03 - 00:15:06: it's understated how it it is very
00:15:05 - 00:15:10: understated and I say this cuz you were
00:15:06 - 00:15:12: a writer for 10 years how important the
00:15:10 - 00:15:14: writing team and Jeff Ross and the
00:15:12 - 00:15:17: production team is to those roasts yeah
00:15:14 - 00:15:18: because they stage it in a way they know
00:15:17 - 00:15:20: what people are going to say they know
00:15:18 - 00:15:22: where they're going to say it they
00:15:20 - 00:15:25: create a [ __ ] recipe for you to
00:15:22 - 00:15:27: succeed yeah and and it's and Jeff Ross
00:15:25 - 00:15:30: I said it to him a 100 times drunk even
00:15:27 - 00:15:33: sober he [ __ ] is the reason everyone
00:15:30 - 00:15:36: love is loving that roast oh yeah it's
00:15:33 - 00:15:37: it's to a large part Jeff oh absolutely
00:15:36 - 00:15:39: and every single one of the roasts that
00:15:37 - 00:15:42: have ever happened before it he's the
00:15:39 - 00:15:44: reason why I'm not kidding you we are
00:15:42 - 00:15:46: such big roast guys him and I that we
00:15:44 - 00:15:48: roasting wasn't like a common term
00:15:46 - 00:15:51: believe it or not it seems like it is
00:15:48 - 00:15:55: now but it wasn't like in the Zeitgeist
00:15:51 - 00:15:57: 10 years ago and so like when that when
00:15:55 - 00:15:59: we started like when we would see a
00:15:57 - 00:16:03: headline on the internet like uh
00:15:59 - 00:16:06: you know uh uh you name it like [ __ ]
00:16:03 - 00:16:08: um Joan Rivers roast Kim Kardashian on
00:16:06 - 00:16:09: The View or something like that when we
00:16:08 - 00:16:12: see when we would see the word roast
00:16:09 - 00:16:14: we'd be like hey that's [ __ ] cool
00:16:12 - 00:16:18: people are say using that word like it
00:16:14 - 00:16:19: was such a old art form did you ever see
00:16:18 - 00:16:20: did you ever see Jeff I don't want to
00:16:19 - 00:16:23: interrupt I want you to keep talking
00:16:20 - 00:16:26: about this going forward with this but
00:16:23 - 00:16:27: uh do you ever see Jeff you ever don't
00:16:26 - 00:16:29: do you ever see Jeff you don't want to
00:16:27 - 00:16:31: interrupt I don't know whatever yeah
00:16:29 - 00:16:33: seems like you kind of do dude I I've
00:16:31 - 00:16:35: been really good this [ __ ]
00:16:33 - 00:16:36: conversation you're my partner I've been
00:16:35 - 00:16:37: really good very proud of you I can't
00:16:36 - 00:16:38: imagine how many times you've wanted to
00:16:37 - 00:16:41: interrupt if you think you've been
00:16:38 - 00:16:41: really
00:16:42 - 00:16:47: good damn your crew is cracking up right
00:16:45 - 00:16:50: now you must interrupt a lot huh you
00:16:47 - 00:16:52: were saying no
00:16:50 - 00:16:55: go you already interrupted you might as
00:16:52 - 00:16:57: well follow through now nope go ahead
00:16:55 - 00:16:59: come on you already did it technically
00:16:57 - 00:17:00: you already interrupted [ __ ] I forgot
00:16:59 - 00:17:03: what I was going to
00:17:00 - 00:17:05: say well that's just a bad Interruption
00:17:03 - 00:17:08: yeah it was Jeff you ever see Jeff Ross
00:17:05 - 00:17:11: when he roasted be Arthur is is probably
00:17:08 - 00:17:12: 20 years ago Jeff Ross did an old school
00:17:11 - 00:17:14: roast with all the Legends and they were
00:17:12 - 00:17:19: doing it at the Fri at the frier
00:17:14 - 00:17:21: club he said God but she's so ugly I
00:17:19 - 00:17:23: wouldn't [ __ ] her with bar Arthur's dick
00:17:21 - 00:17:26: and then the camera cuts to bar arur and
00:17:23 - 00:17:28: he goes is she still alive I mean he he
00:17:26 - 00:17:32: did you ever see his roast of of sha the
00:17:28 - 00:17:35: sha roast oh yeah Shaq and EMT Smith's
00:17:32 - 00:17:36: roast EMT Smith yeah it's yeah you know
00:17:35 - 00:17:37: Shaq brought that up when I talked to
00:17:36 - 00:17:40: Shaq he was like did you ever see that
00:17:37 - 00:17:43: and I was like it's the hardest i' it is
00:17:40 - 00:17:45: the most inappropriate wildest yeah well
00:17:43 - 00:17:49: that's the thing is like and you know I
00:17:45 - 00:17:51: learned from him a lot about like okay
00:17:49 - 00:17:52: so you could do this but if you do this
00:17:51 - 00:17:55: then you can't do that and if you you
00:17:52 - 00:17:59: know what I mean you can't go too much
00:17:55 - 00:18:01: one extreme so you know there was cut I
00:17:59 - 00:18:03: was making well first of all if you want
00:18:01 - 00:18:06: to get into it how did kind of crazy cuz
00:18:03 - 00:18:07: this is kind of like a hot scoop yeah
00:18:06 - 00:18:09: let's all right so let's get into it
00:18:07 - 00:18:12: first of all I've never been a Netflix
00:18:09 - 00:18:15: darling the special that I was lucky to
00:18:12 - 00:18:18: get to make with a steady cam in 2015
00:18:15 - 00:18:20: seven years into my career uh was a
00:18:18 - 00:18:22: miracle they were looking for something
00:18:20 - 00:18:25: different with continuity and I and it
00:18:22 - 00:18:26: was like a year after Birdman came out
00:18:25 - 00:18:28: so I'm like what if somebody shot a
00:18:26 - 00:18:30: special like that one take and all I had
00:18:28 - 00:18:32: was one show at the ice house I wasn't
00:18:30 - 00:18:35: that good the difference between a seven
00:18:32 - 00:18:39: or eighty year comedian doing an hour
00:18:35 - 00:18:41: special 15 years right it's light years
00:18:39 - 00:18:43: um but I was lucky to get it at the time
00:18:41 - 00:18:46: and it worked and then once that
00:18:43 - 00:18:48: two-year licensing deal was up and gone
00:18:46 - 00:18:49: I'm like [ __ ] this special get it out of
00:18:48 - 00:18:53: here I'm so much better I don't want
00:18:49 - 00:18:56: anybody to see it right so and it seemed
00:18:53 - 00:18:58: like they weren't knocking at the door
00:18:56 - 00:19:00: anyway you know I think they have a
00:18:58 - 00:19:01: thing with likable people or a thing
00:19:00 - 00:19:05: that they can see or something that
00:19:01 - 00:19:08: tests well or whatever and um so they
00:19:05 - 00:19:10: didn't want me on this thing to to start
00:19:08 - 00:19:12: and I knew that like this was clear I'm
00:19:10 - 00:19:15: just not an industry guy I mean clearly
00:19:12 - 00:19:18: i' I've my show my hit show is on
00:19:15 - 00:19:21: YouTube yeah and you don't see me much
00:19:18 - 00:19:23: more other than that so but I have a
00:19:21 - 00:19:27: great team a great agent a great manager
00:19:23 - 00:19:29: for the first time ever and um so I hit
00:19:27 - 00:19:30: them up and I'm like hey I'm making you
00:19:29 - 00:19:32: guys all this money I want you to do
00:19:30 - 00:19:34: something for me I want to get on this
00:19:32 - 00:19:36: thing which is crazy cuz in the
00:19:34 - 00:19:38: beginning when they first announced it
00:19:36 - 00:19:40: I'm like Ah that's cool they're going to
00:19:38 - 00:19:43: do a rose to Tom Brady that's great but
00:19:40 - 00:19:46: as it got closer and I'm like live Tom
00:19:43 - 00:19:50: Brady I have a feeling this might be the
00:19:46 - 00:19:52: biggest comedy event like ever in this
00:19:50 - 00:19:54: period are you at all hitting up Ross
00:19:52 - 00:19:55: because he's your friend I did hit up
00:19:54 - 00:19:57: Ross when they first announced it to
00:19:55 - 00:19:59: congratulate him and I feel like he
00:19:57 - 00:20:01: thought that I was going to asked to get
00:19:59 - 00:20:04: on it but honestly at the time again
00:20:01 - 00:20:06: this was like two months before I I was
00:20:04 - 00:20:08: just like oh that's cool this could be
00:20:06 - 00:20:11: the start of a cool era of roasting on
00:20:08 - 00:20:13: Netflix but then as it got closer I
00:20:11 - 00:20:15: realized like no this could be this
00:20:13 - 00:20:18: could be like the biggest coolest
00:20:15 - 00:20:21: craziest thing ever like I it's so my
00:20:18 - 00:20:22: tone on it just changed and I didn't
00:20:21 - 00:20:24: just I didn't just want to hit up Ross
00:20:22 - 00:20:26: and be like hey get me on this thing
00:20:24 - 00:20:29: like he knew that you know I'm a great
00:20:26 - 00:20:30: guy for the job if it's live on Netflix
00:20:29 - 00:20:33: who better than the guy that roasts
00:20:30 - 00:20:35: people live every week every week on a
00:20:33 - 00:20:37: big ass show in front of a big ass
00:20:35 - 00:20:39: audience that happens to do Arenas which
00:20:37 - 00:20:41: is where this is being shot a few days
00:20:39 - 00:20:43: before I do it anyway plus I've written
00:20:41 - 00:20:47: on the last 10 Comedy Central roasts
00:20:43 - 00:20:49: plus I've done crazy roast myself and so
00:20:47 - 00:20:50: it was kind of like all that mixed
00:20:49 - 00:20:53: together and then I was mentioning it to
00:20:50 - 00:20:54: Joe that Netflix is doing this Tom Brady
00:20:53 - 00:20:56: roast and he goes I'll message Tom Brady
00:20:54 - 00:20:58: you know
00:20:56 - 00:21:00: Joe really Joe's like I'll message Tom
00:20:58 - 00:21:03: Brady for you I'm like really you do
00:21:00 - 00:21:04: that and he sure enough he does and he
00:21:03 - 00:21:06: says Tony's the best Ro he sent me a
00:21:04 - 00:21:07: screenshot of it Tony's the best roaster

00:21:34 - 00:21:41: [ __ ] anyway so we should tell you our
00:21:38 - 00:21:41: story I think it'll really frustrate

00:22:04 - 00:22:10: the same time okay anyway tell wait so
00:22:08 - 00:22:13: this is pretty huge in the fact that the
00:22:10 - 00:22:15: guy who is the roast is about yeah uh
00:22:13 - 00:22:17: who's happens to be one of the most
00:22:15 - 00:22:19: powerful most famous people is like I

00:30:45 - 00:30:51: you don't want other writers or anybody
00:30:48 - 00:30:52: to hear any of your actual material I
00:30:51 - 00:30:54: mean they could hear your guys's
00:30:52 - 00:30:59: material but I mean my good material I
00:30:54 - 00:30:59: didn't want them to hear any killer jok
00:30:59 - 00:31:03: because you know it's a sneaky business
00:31:01 - 00:31:04: especially in Hollywood that's why oh
00:31:03 - 00:31:07: one of the many reasons why I got the
00:31:04 - 00:31:10: [ __ ] out is like make your own [ __ ] save
00:31:07 - 00:31:12: it for you enough giving it away so I
00:31:10 - 00:31:14: wasn't doing any of my jokes during the
00:31:12 - 00:31:15: blocking thing and they're like Tony
00:31:14 - 00:31:17: show us what you're going to do how far
00:31:15 - 00:31:19: ahead were you doing like were you
00:31:17 - 00:31:22: prepping these the jokes so what's crazy
00:31:19 - 00:31:25: is that I put together a small
00:31:22 - 00:31:28: four-person Army immediately I treated
00:31:25 - 00:31:31: this like I had my own [ __ ] like I
00:31:28 - 00:31:34: was on the thing like I was going to do
00:31:31 - 00:31:37: a full set immediately at my giant
00:31:34 - 00:31:40: [ __ ] you know office that I have
00:31:37 - 00:31:43: anyway so like I treated it and maybe
00:31:40 - 00:31:45: it's not necessarily manifestation but
00:31:43 - 00:31:47: it was extreme preparation another place
00:31:45 - 00:31:51: where we differed keep going oh
00:31:47 - 00:31:53: preparation yeah Preparation H maybe am
00:31:51 - 00:31:55: I right hemorrhoid guys no I'm kidding
00:31:53 - 00:31:58: anyway uh but I really did and I was
00:31:55 - 00:32:00: obsessed with it and you know it was
00:31:58 - 00:32:04: kind of crazy cuz I'm like holy [ __ ] I
00:32:00 - 00:32:05: am only obsessing about this right now
00:32:04 - 00:32:07: but if it goes good it'll give me four
00:32:05 - 00:32:09: or five days to obsess about my show at
00:32:07 - 00:32:11: the Forum which I had already put a lot
00:32:09 - 00:32:13: of effort into before the roast thing so
00:32:11 - 00:32:16: it's kind of crazy because I put all my
00:32:13 - 00:32:18: chips into this roast which is crazy
00:32:16 - 00:32:19: because again I knew I was two hours
00:32:18 - 00:32:21: into the show at this point because
00:32:19 - 00:32:23: that's important and I figured that out
00:32:21 - 00:32:25: I know that about roasting because the
00:32:23 - 00:32:27: deeper are you in the deeper you're in
00:32:25 - 00:32:29: the more you have to kind of cut or
00:32:27 - 00:32:30: readjust
00:32:29 - 00:32:33: and so you're really dialed into what's
00:32:30 - 00:32:35: happening on stage right super would you
00:32:33 - 00:32:38: be did you edit I think you edited
00:32:35 - 00:32:39: something out oh tons yeah no I'm saying
00:32:38 - 00:32:43: even from prompter right cuz I think oh
00:32:39 - 00:32:45: 100% I Wasing things around I know I was
00:32:43 - 00:32:48: switching things around and moving
00:32:45 - 00:32:51: things and sliding in new things and new
00:32:48 - 00:32:53: headers and new sweeteners and the even
00:32:51 - 00:32:54: the nice shoes [ __ ] did you win those
00:32:53 - 00:32:56: in the divorce the bellich check
00:32:54 - 00:32:58: everything that I started with which is
00:32:56 - 00:33:01: a huge [ __ ] risk everything that I
00:32:58 - 00:33:03: started with I wrote at the table I got
00:33:01 - 00:33:06: you like I'm like okay nobody's hit that
00:33:03 - 00:33:08: he Randy Moss was begging for a ring
00:33:06 - 00:33:11: bill bich che's phone isn't ringing ring
00:33:08 - 00:33:12: ring those shoes that Tom I was staring
00:33:11 - 00:33:14: at Tom Brady's shoes the whole time
00:33:12 - 00:33:16: because his pant legs were riding high
00:33:14 - 00:33:17: and I'm literally right there like God
00:33:16 - 00:33:19: those are some gay [ __ ] shoes I
00:33:17 - 00:33:21: wonder if they'll zoom in if I hit them
00:33:19 - 00:33:23: on this cuz they were they were they
00:33:21 - 00:33:25: were like women's boots and by the way
00:33:23 - 00:33:28: that's another thing you talk about like
00:33:25 - 00:33:29: especially a risk at the top of the set
00:33:28 - 00:33:31: in that situation first of all I could
00:33:29 - 00:33:34: have fallen up the [ __ ] stairs like
00:33:31 - 00:33:36: it's live anything could go wrong and
00:33:34 - 00:33:38: when I said my opening line that when I
00:33:36 - 00:33:40: did that turn from Dana and I go nice
00:33:38 - 00:33:41: shoes [ __ ] and I'm [ __ ] making sure
00:33:40 - 00:33:43: I'm not falling up the stairs did you
00:33:41 - 00:33:46: win those in the divorce he goes and I
00:33:43 - 00:33:47: don't think anybody noticed this he goes
00:33:46 - 00:33:50: yeah I'll shove one of these right up
00:33:47 - 00:33:52: your [ __ ] ass because he was not he
00:33:50 - 00:33:54: didn't know who he didn't he he must not
00:33:52 - 00:33:56: he must not have remembered who the [ __ ]
00:33:54 - 00:33:58: I am or whatever oh he said it in the
00:33:56 - 00:34:00: moment and if you watch that roast if
00:33:58 - 00:34:02: you watch it you can't really see it
00:34:00 - 00:34:05: there cuz the pant legs are down but
00:34:02 - 00:34:07: they go high they're so gay yeah anyway
00:34:05 - 00:34:11: he goes I'll shove it up your ass and at
00:34:07 - 00:34:13: that moment like you'll you'll notice if
00:34:11 - 00:34:15: you rewatch it like I go oh hey
00:34:13 - 00:34:16: everybody it's a quite AAS up here cuz
00:34:15 - 00:34:20: my brain is
00:34:16 - 00:34:23: going do you acknowledge what Tom Brady
00:34:20 - 00:34:25: just said or do you plow forward it's a
00:34:23 - 00:34:29: million dooll moment right now you made
00:34:25 - 00:34:31: the call oh God I should acknowledge it
00:34:29 - 00:34:32: but it wasn't miked nobody else heard it
00:34:31 - 00:34:35: it's too early it could throw off
00:34:32 - 00:34:36: everything ignore ignore ignore let's go
00:34:35 - 00:34:38: let's go let's go run the ball run the
00:34:36 - 00:34:42: ball run I always go back to like
00:34:38 - 00:34:44: football or UFC analogies anyway um so I
00:34:42 - 00:34:46: ignore that which is [ __ ] great that
00:34:44 - 00:34:48: I did because all I've made those
00:34:46 - 00:34:51: mistakes before on [ __ ] you know that's
00:34:48 - 00:34:52: the the difference between guys that are
00:34:51 - 00:34:53: doing a roast for the first time and
00:34:52 - 00:34:56: guys like you have been doing it for
00:34:53 - 00:34:58: [ __ ] 15 plus years yes exactly and
00:34:56 - 00:35:00: again kill Tony help everything helps
00:34:58 - 00:35:02: you have to know what to ignore and what
00:35:00 - 00:35:04: to move on keep the momentum going
00:35:02 - 00:35:06: that's the thing for performing regular
00:35:04 - 00:35:08: shows too when you're when especially
00:35:06 - 00:35:11: when you're when you're doing standup in
00:35:08 - 00:35:12: arenas sometimes you um you hear
00:35:11 - 00:35:15: something or see something and your
00:35:12 - 00:35:17: brain in a moment has to go is that
00:35:15 - 00:35:20: worth acknowledging because you realize
00:35:17 - 00:35:22: 15,000 people didn't see that are you
00:35:20 - 00:35:25: going to derail the show exactly unless
00:35:22 - 00:35:27: it's like noteworthy you don't you let
00:35:25 - 00:35:29: things slide you know you have to
00:35:27 - 00:35:31: exactly and all of a sudden people at
00:35:29 - 00:35:33: home are like what the [ __ ] is he
00:35:31 - 00:35:36: talking say like I bet you'd love to do
00:35:33 - 00:35:37: that Tom yeah huh do what that's not the
00:35:36 - 00:35:39: only thing you want to shove up my ass
00:35:37 - 00:35:41: what was your next joke right after that
00:35:39 - 00:35:43: after the shoes up the ass I went
00:35:41 - 00:35:45: straight to because the positioning had
00:35:43 - 00:35:48: changed so like so many things changed
00:35:45 - 00:35:50: originally I had Kevin Hart's Shadow uh
00:35:48 - 00:35:52: Randy Moss that's not your Shadow that's
00:35:50 - 00:35:56: Randy Moss but now grank was sitting in
00:35:52 - 00:35:59: between or no not grank uh bellich was
00:35:56 - 00:36:01: sitting in between grank and Randy Moss
00:35:59 - 00:36:03: so instead of abandoning that joke
00:36:01 - 00:36:06: completely I switched it to grank Kevin
00:36:03 - 00:36:08: Hart and I wrote the Randy because now
00:36:06 - 00:36:09: I'm like I didn't realize Randy Moss was
00:36:08 - 00:36:11: going to be next to bill bellich because
00:36:09 - 00:36:13: that wasn't in the blocking thing bill
00:36:11 - 00:36:16: bich was a special guest came out late
00:36:13 - 00:36:18: so I'm like oh I can go this way so I go
00:36:16 - 00:36:19: Randy Moss crazy that you asked bill
00:36:18 - 00:36:21: bich for a ring you know what else
00:36:19 - 00:36:24: doesn't have a ring bill bellich che's
00:36:21 - 00:36:27: phone and then I but we're here for Tom
00:36:24 - 00:36:29: Aaron Hernandez stool and all this stuff
00:36:27 - 00:36:32: Kevin Hart Kevin Hart Kevin Hart Kevin
00:36:29 - 00:36:34: Hart right so I was moving now
00:36:32 - 00:36:37: geographically can I interrup instead of
00:36:34 - 00:36:39: yeah was it your choice to walk the de
00:36:37 - 00:36:40: cuz that was my favorite part so I
00:36:39 - 00:36:42: didn't actually get to finish when Geron
00:36:40 - 00:36:43: and Benji and everybody in this
00:36:42 - 00:36:46: rehearsal are coming in and they're like
00:36:43 - 00:36:49: it's a desk piece and I'm like having me
00:36:46 - 00:36:51: sit at this table and shooting it like
00:36:49 - 00:36:53: that for a minute is like hiring the
00:36:51 - 00:36:55: world's greatest sushi chef to make you
00:36:53 - 00:36:57: a peanut butter and jelly sandwich you
00:36:55 - 00:36:59: guys have to let me cook I don't even
00:36:57 - 00:37:01: like you like cool slangs like that but
00:36:59 - 00:37:03: I had heard it recently and I'm like I
00:37:01 - 00:37:05: kind of like that like you have to let
00:37:03 - 00:37:07: me cook let me cook someone make that to
00:37:05 - 00:37:10: as a t-shirt y let me c Tony henchcliffe
00:37:07 - 00:37:12: let him cook yeah and [ __ ] great and
00:37:10 - 00:37:14: I did and I said it and I go you guys
00:37:12 - 00:37:17: think I'm crazy but and the director
00:37:14 - 00:37:20: lady who was awesome um she directed
00:37:17 - 00:37:22: like 12 years of Satur exactly so she
00:37:20 - 00:37:25: was there now too in this rehearsal
00:37:22 - 00:37:27: we're going back 24 hours and I go call
00:37:25 - 00:37:30: me crazy but shouldn't it be like this
00:37:27 - 00:37:32: and I'm up there doing it and I'm moving
00:37:30 - 00:37:34: and I see her like yeah cuz she has
00:37:32 - 00:37:35: something to do now that isn't just
00:37:34 - 00:37:39: shooting the [ __ ] Podium we're
00:37:35 - 00:37:41: shooting straight on you know it's like
00:37:39 - 00:37:43: mixes it up yeah it breaks up the
00:37:41 - 00:37:45: monotony and I had to come up with that
00:37:43 - 00:37:48: idea the best though is that you told me
00:37:45 - 00:37:50: later because when you were done you sat
00:37:48 - 00:37:52: down next to me MH and later on you were
00:37:50 - 00:37:55: like yeah I was told to go back to my
00:37:52 - 00:37:58: seat but I [ __ ] decided to sit right
00:37:55 - 00:38:01: here let them know I'm sitting actually
00:37:58 - 00:38:02: one of their original ideas was that's
00:38:01 - 00:38:04: what's crazy is they go it's a desk
00:38:02 - 00:38:07: piece but when you're done you can go up
00:38:04 - 00:38:10: and sit up on the second level with the
00:38:07 - 00:38:12: with the players I'm like why would I do
00:38:10 - 00:38:14: that why I just look like a like a like
00:38:12 - 00:38:16: an intruder or something I want to be
00:38:14 - 00:38:19: part of this now like that's so weird
00:38:16 - 00:38:24: let me do what I can do and then I'll
00:38:19 - 00:38:25: end up there yeah and so you know so I
00:38:24 - 00:38:27: got it cuz the director was in and my
00:38:25 - 00:38:29: homies were like yeah that looks great
00:38:27 - 00:38:32: and Jeff's like yeah man that looks
00:38:29 - 00:38:34: great so you know and you know no
00:38:32 - 00:38:37: disrespect in Netflix or the EP cuz they
00:38:34 - 00:38:38: couldn't have known of I'm just some
00:38:37 - 00:38:40: [ __ ] rabble Rouser that's just
00:38:38 - 00:38:41: shooting my shot it could have seemed
00:38:40 - 00:38:45: like I'm going to go up there and
00:38:41 - 00:38:46: [ __ ] you know but everybody looked
00:38:45 - 00:38:49: good in the end they look like [ __ ]
00:38:46 - 00:38:50: Geniuses yeah for sure but so many
00:38:49 - 00:38:52: switches were happening in the Moment
00:38:50 - 00:38:53: Like if you guys knew it would Boggle
00:38:52 - 00:38:57: your mind you want to hear about our
00:38:53 - 00:38:59: story oh yeah let's do it so they called

00:42:11 - 00:42:15: on the de all you do is go that was fun
00:42:13 - 00:42:18: fun as [ __ ] look it's like it's like
00:42:15 - 00:42:21: when you see a boxer or a wrestler
00:42:18 - 00:42:24: attempt the
00:42:21 - 00:42:26: UFC it's the U it's it's a it's you

00:42:26 - 00:42:34: standup ComEd
00:42:28 - 00:42:36: and where Niki experience we were doing
00:42:34 - 00:42:38: this Peter Shore the owner of the comedy
00:42:36 - 00:42:40: stores doing a mini documentary behind
00:42:38 - 00:42:42: the scenes about kill Tony going to
00:42:40 - 00:42:44: Madison Square Garden it just so
00:42:42 - 00:42:47: happened that we're staying at the same
00:42:44 - 00:42:49: hotel in LA and he's shooting this thing
00:42:47 - 00:42:52: from the driver's seat me on the way to
00:42:49 - 00:42:54: the roast and I give this weird analysis
00:42:52 - 00:42:55: just looking out the window I kind of
00:42:54 - 00:42:57: forget that he's there I'm just talking
00:42:55 - 00:42:59: to my team kind of like talking out
00:42:57 - 00:43:02: meditative like as corny as this sounds
00:42:59 - 00:43:04: like State CU it's jokes who cares but
00:43:02 - 00:43:07: anyway and I literally called what was
00:43:04 - 00:43:10: going to happen because I know this
00:43:07 - 00:43:12: world so well yeah and I knew the order
00:43:10 - 00:43:16: of events and I literally go it's going
00:43:12 - 00:43:19: to be a [ __ ] smoke show the first 20
00:43:16 - 00:43:21: 30 minutes I go the energy is going to
00:43:19 - 00:43:23: be insane it's going to be beautiful
00:43:21 - 00:43:25: Tom's going to look great it's going to
00:43:23 - 00:43:26: be intimidating he's going to be taller
00:43:25 - 00:43:29: than everybody remembers he's going to
00:43:26 - 00:43:32: be cool cooler than everybody thinks and
00:43:29 - 00:43:34: Jeff and Nikki are going to light the
00:43:32 - 00:43:37: place on fire I go
00:43:34 - 00:43:38: especially I mean Jeff we know what he's
00:43:37 - 00:43:40: going to do so you can't Jeff can't have
00:43:38 - 00:43:42: a breakout performance because he's Jeff
00:43:40 - 00:43:45: he's done it he is a breakout
00:43:42 - 00:43:48: performance Nikki and I go Nikki is
00:43:45 - 00:43:51: going to decimate the room and everybody
00:43:48 - 00:43:54: is going to be playing catchup so me two
00:43:51 - 00:43:56: hours in after everybody and their
00:43:54 - 00:43:58: mother and every special guest has to
00:43:56 - 00:44:00: [ __ ] just know that that's going to
00:43:58 - 00:44:03: happen I can't be like oh when there's
00:44:00 - 00:44:05: no catching up to that mentality I'm
00:44:03 - 00:44:08: gonna ask you a very [ __ ] up question
00:44:05 - 00:44:11: okay but I I've I've wondered this uhhuh
00:44:08 - 00:44:13: if you had put Schultz in Nikki's spot
00:44:11 - 00:44:14: would everyone be talking about Schultz
00:44:13 - 00:44:16: and not
00:44:14 - 00:44:20: Nikki if you would have put Nikki in
00:44:16 - 00:44:23: Schultz's spot and Schultz in
00:44:20 - 00:44:27: Nikki's it's a flow thing if you look at
00:44:23 - 00:44:29: Nikki's style which she stayed cons
00:44:27 - 00:44:31: throughout her roasting career if you
00:44:29 - 00:44:33: look at her style she does this
00:44:31 - 00:44:37: continuity thing she does this thing
00:44:33 - 00:44:37: where she goes bird I love your
00:44:38 - 00:44:45: joke punchline pun line punchline and
00:44:43 - 00:44:48: it's just continuous and it she's so
00:44:45 - 00:44:51: good you gotta you gotta hand it to
00:44:48 - 00:44:54: Kevin because he can't reach it bow bow
00:44:51 - 00:44:57: short which I love if you look you know
00:44:54 - 00:44:59: the I'm like known in the writer room
00:44:57 - 00:45:02: for sending in eight-word jokes where so
00:44:59 - 00:45:04: many people you could see you can we
00:45:02 - 00:45:06: used to do this thing right all the
00:45:04 - 00:45:08: writers say there's [ __ ] 12 16
00:45:06 - 00:45:10: writers or whatever everybody sends in
00:45:08 - 00:45:11: all their jokes a writer's assistant
00:45:10 - 00:45:14: compiles them and then we read them in
00:45:11 - 00:45:18: the room and all laugh right you could
00:45:14 - 00:45:20: see where my jokes start you can tell
00:45:18 - 00:45:22: because it's these [ __ ] lers where
00:45:20 - 00:45:24: everybody else has like you know three
00:45:22 - 00:45:27: lines or a paragraph or whatever the
00:45:24 - 00:45:29: [ __ ] it is you know sometimes two lines
00:45:27 - 00:45:31: whatever and if I have a long one if I
00:45:29 - 00:45:34: have a long one in my Clump it's like
00:45:31 - 00:45:36: the Bert Tiger King liver
00:45:34 - 00:45:38: King people are like what the [ __ ] is
00:45:36 - 00:45:40: that such a great joke but like I'm
00:45:38 - 00:45:42: obsessed with short jokes it's one of
00:45:40 - 00:45:44: the reasons why you know Jeff and I
00:45:42 - 00:45:46: clung together immediately he's like
00:45:44 - 00:45:51: what the [ __ ] Peter make me another
00:45:46 - 00:45:53: drink please um so it's it's it's it's
00:45:51 - 00:45:55: I'm not taking away from Nikki I'm not
00:45:53 - 00:45:59: taking away from Nikki Nikki I look I've
00:45:55 - 00:46:02: known Nikki years she is [ __ ] when I
00:45:59 - 00:46:04: stood backstage and I saw first of all
00:46:02 - 00:46:06: she was like 6'4 in that outfit she
00:46:04 - 00:46:08: looks stunning she was my eye was drawn
00:46:06 - 00:46:11: to her out of all those people and I was
00:46:08 - 00:46:13: like oh she's going to f she is walk was
00:46:11 - 00:46:15: there tocer undeniable it was also a
00:46:13 - 00:46:17: Flawless set it was a perfect exactly
00:46:15 - 00:46:20: Flawless so my point is is like it's not
00:46:17 - 00:46:23: who's funnier or necessarily position
00:46:20 - 00:46:25: it's a battle of styles Schultz had you
00:46:23 - 00:46:28: know it's like a Reload you know he's
00:46:25 - 00:46:31: moving on does this make sense there's
00:46:28 - 00:46:32: breaks in the momentum yeah and you know
00:46:31 - 00:46:36: this person's
00:46:32 - 00:46:38: here boom and it's great it's huge it's
00:46:36 - 00:46:40: a re reset right it's a reset so the
00:46:38 - 00:46:42: momentum breaks he's restarting on
00:46:40 - 00:46:44: somebody else thought me Schultz and Tom
00:46:42 - 00:46:46: were all sitting together and after
00:46:44 - 00:46:48: Nikki all of us were like holy [ __ ] man
00:46:46 - 00:46:50: this is like this is it's going to be a
00:46:48 - 00:46:52: tough Hill to climb oh exactly and but
00:46:50 - 00:46:54: Schultz I think Schultz was masterful he
00:46:52 - 00:46:57: was so [ __ ] good oh totally totally I
00:46:54 - 00:47:01: almost I would argue he is not brought
00:46:57 - 00:47:04: I'm as and look you and Nikki owned that
00:47:01 - 00:47:07: evening MH I have nothing I have no
00:47:04 - 00:47:09: flowers to take other than to give but I
00:47:07 - 00:47:10: do believe that people are understating
00:47:09 - 00:47:12: no one's really talking about how great
00:47:10 - 00:47:14: Schultz was and I look as a standup
00:47:12 - 00:47:17: comedian and I love
00:47:14 - 00:47:19: Andrew he three hours in this
00:47:17 - 00:47:22: [ __ ] goes out up after everyone
00:47:19 - 00:47:25: has ringed this goddamn thing dry and
00:47:22 - 00:47:28: still crushes still so people should be
00:47:25 - 00:47:30: writing about him going like this dude
00:47:28 - 00:47:32: had the [ __ ] he was the [ __ ] last
00:47:30 - 00:47:34: dude in the orgy and his dick was still
00:47:32 - 00:47:37: rock hard and he blew a load in her and
00:47:34 - 00:47:41: he kissed her on the lips oh 100% no he
00:47:37 - 00:47:43: was great and now I'm hard yeah um but
00:47:41 - 00:47:46: it's really you know another thing is
00:47:43 - 00:47:49: that with Nick the way Nikki writes and
00:47:46 - 00:47:52: connects it all like a like a model
00:47:49 - 00:47:54: train almost like it's like it all flows
00:47:52 - 00:47:56: and if you look at her old roast like if
00:47:54 - 00:47:58: you see an old clip of the things she's
00:47:56 - 00:48:00: done before she's is doing that there
00:47:58 - 00:48:01: she's so good you want this was so
00:48:00 - 00:48:04: Amplified this will probably make some
00:48:01 - 00:48:06: people crazy maybe make you crazy few
00:48:04 - 00:48:09: nights later I was at the Forum for my
00:48:06 - 00:48:11: show yeah Netflix Executives came by
00:48:09 - 00:48:13: that show talking about the roast asked
00:48:11 - 00:48:15: if I wanted to be involved in the next
00:48:13 - 00:48:17: roast oh wow and that's after that set

00:48:43 - 00:48:47: guys like the one of the coolest parts
00:48:45 - 00:48:51: of the thing from my story just to let
00:48:47 - 00:48:54: you know what an underdog I was in this
00:48:51 - 00:48:57: is in the final thing it was like okay
00:48:54 - 00:49:01: you can roam the stage but let's keep it
00:48:57 - 00:49:03: to 2 minutes 2 minutes which is like
00:49:01 - 00:49:05: crazy that's like five jokes with
00:49:03 - 00:49:07: Applause breaks yeah you know I know

00:49:16 - 00:49:20: and get in cuz I was like I was like oh
00:49:18 - 00:49:21: he's running this yeah and for the 17
00:49:20 - 00:49:23: people that are excited about the
00:49:21 - 00:49:26: technical side of roasting that I'm
00:49:23 - 00:49:29: talking about here's a crazy fun fact is
00:49:26 - 00:49:31: that it was only on that day before the
00:49:29 - 00:49:33: day before in which I had this like
00:49:31 - 00:49:34: Breakthrough because I'm a stoner most
00:49:33 - 00:49:36: people don't know because I don't like
00:49:34 - 00:49:38: make up my Identity or anything you know
00:49:36 - 00:49:42: what I mean but I smoke blonds all the
00:49:38 - 00:49:44: time um and like I was just kind of
00:49:42 - 00:49:47: chilling and I had this like moment
00:49:44 - 00:49:49: where I'm like wait a second every other
00:49:47 - 00:49:52: comedian is going to be going off of
00:49:49 - 00:49:53: Arena timing they're going to want to
00:49:52 - 00:49:55: look good they're going to want to get
00:49:53 - 00:49:58: Applause breaks they're going to want to
00:49:55 - 00:50:02: soak it in they're giving me a shorter
00:49:58 - 00:50:05: set than everybody else and I'm other
00:50:02 - 00:50:08: than Jeff the roasti comedian that has
00:50:05 - 00:50:11: anything to do with this thing so I am
00:50:08 - 00:50:13: going to hit the [ __ ] gas pedal you
00:50:11 - 00:50:15: did and I'm going to play for the people
00:50:13 - 00:50:16: that are watching at home or the people
00:50:15 - 00:50:19: that are screen grabbing it for the
00:50:16 - 00:50:22: internet I'm going to play towards them
00:50:19 - 00:50:25: and send some two hours in like I
00:50:22 - 00:50:26: couldn't do that early on right in Nikki
00:50:25 - 00:50:28: spot or else it would seem like this
00:50:26 - 00:50:30: guy's like too rapid fire right exactly
00:50:28 - 00:50:34: what's he doing what's does he have a
00:50:30 - 00:50:36: problem what's anyway so like I had this
00:50:34 - 00:50:38: moment and I ran it by uh Whitney
00:50:36 - 00:50:40: Cummings at uh at a brunch the day
00:50:38 - 00:50:44: before I go let me ask you something
00:50:40 - 00:50:46: she's a [ __ ] gangster genius and I go
00:50:44 - 00:50:48: I think I'm GNA play this thing like
00:50:46 - 00:50:50: fast and hard because I'm two hours in
00:50:48 - 00:50:53: she's like that's exactly it you have to
00:50:50 - 00:50:56: [ __ ] make it yours go over the top
00:50:53 - 00:50:58: I'm like yeah that sounds right and it
00:50:56 - 00:51:00: was it was my secret weapon I watched
00:50:58 - 00:51:02: your pacing on that and it was and it
00:51:00 - 00:51:04: was you know look Tom said this Tom gave
00:51:02 - 00:51:08: you this compliment behind your
00:51:04 - 00:51:10: back they were talking about uh people
00:51:08 - 00:51:12: were saying like how great was that Rose
00:51:10 - 00:51:16: how great was Tony henchcliffe in that
00:51:12 - 00:51:20: way Tom's like you know we've watched
00:51:16 - 00:51:22: this guy cook his entire life and he's
00:51:20 - 00:51:24: like we've watched this guy be a monster
00:51:22 - 00:51:26: his entire career we knew he had that
00:51:24 - 00:51:28: ability I don't think we just got to
00:51:26 - 00:51:30: watch watch him shine to everyone the
00:51:28 - 00:51:32: way he's always shined to us and it was
00:51:30 - 00:51:34: a bunch of very important people and
00:51:32 - 00:51:36: everyone's like really and Tom's like
00:51:34 - 00:51:38: man that guy did exactly what he does
00:51:36 - 00:51:40: every single [ __ ] night he just got
00:51:38 - 00:51:43: the platform to do it on and it exactly
00:51:40 - 00:51:45: what it felt like to me again I always
00:51:43 - 00:51:48: make corny UFC analogies because it's my
00:51:45 - 00:51:50: other favorite thing but like it and
00:51:48 - 00:51:53: this is obnoxious to say but it really
00:51:50 - 00:51:54: felt like my like Nate Diaz versus
00:51:53 - 00:51:57: Connor moment where everybody was
00:51:54 - 00:51:59: shocked except for me and even I was
00:51:57 - 00:52:01: [ __ ] like when Kevin Hart that moment
00:51:59 - 00:52:03: you remember that moment where he's
00:52:01 - 00:52:05: going on and on for a minute 30 seconds
00:52:03 - 00:52:07: and I Turn to You and that was real by
00:52:05 - 00:52:10: the way I wasn't kidding I literally go
00:52:07 - 00:52:12: is he still talking about me and you go
00:52:10 - 00:52:15: yes and I remember your face like yeah
00:52:12 - 00:52:17: dude this is your [ __ ] moment right
00:52:15 - 00:52:20: now well then Tony turned to me he goes
00:52:17 - 00:52:23: I've arrived I said that yeah and you go
00:52:20 - 00:52:26: and now everybody knows I said you know
00:52:23 - 00:52:29: it's so funny it's what you did is is is
00:52:26 - 00:52:32: I will say is bigger than a Netflix
00:52:29 - 00:52:35: special it feels that way it is I mean I
00:52:32 - 00:52:39: mean it was bigger than a Netflix
00:52:35 - 00:52:42: special what Nikki did what n Nick and
00:52:39 - 00:52:43: Nikki eclipsed everyone oh yeah and I'm
00:52:42 - 00:52:45: saying the two takeaways were you and
00:52:43 - 00:52:47: Nikki that was it that was it for the
00:52:45 - 00:52:51: whole night and I think it it goes
00:52:47 - 00:52:54: understated how brilliant Kevin Hart was
00:52:51 - 00:52:56: Kevin Hart was brilliant he set the
00:52:54 - 00:52:58: stage he set the energy for that get
00:52:56 - 00:53:00: talked about because he's like a
00:52:58 - 00:53:01: superstar and he does all this [ __ ] and
00:53:00 - 00:53:04: you know the jokes are like he does
00:53:01 - 00:53:06: everything but watching him just as the
00:53:04 - 00:53:09: host of that and the energy and the J
00:53:06 - 00:53:11: like he was fantastic him that's it's
00:53:09 - 00:53:12: the Jeff Ross effect right it's like
00:53:11 - 00:53:14: you're so used to them doing that that
00:53:12 - 00:53:18: it's not that big of a deal but without
00:53:14 - 00:53:21: them it is a [ __ ] show Jes killed it
00:53:18 - 00:53:22: grank killed it that thing all you I
00:53:21 - 00:53:25: said to Tom cuz Tom and I thought we
00:53:22 - 00:53:26: were going to absolutely bomb we did and
00:53:25 - 00:53:28: we said that to each other we're like
00:53:26 - 00:53:30: we're to eat a dick it's going to be bad
00:53:28 - 00:53:32: and I remember I kissed him I said buddy
00:53:30 - 00:53:34: if we die we die together that's so
00:53:32 - 00:53:36: great and I and and because I'm cool
00:53:34 - 00:53:38: ding next to him I'm cool with it I he
00:53:36 - 00:53:39: said one time we were talking about
00:53:38 - 00:53:41: cancel culture I remember in I don't
00:53:39 - 00:53:42: know if he said it on podcast or he said
00:53:41 - 00:53:45: it to me privately and he said let them
00:53:42 - 00:53:47: go after my buddy way do you see what I
00:53:45 - 00:53:49: burn down and I was like okay I got that
00:53:47 - 00:53:51: for you then if we die we die together I
00:53:49 - 00:53:52: will tell you I don't give a [ __ ] what
00:53:51 - 00:53:55: anyone says on the internet we didn't
00:53:52 - 00:53:57: die we had a great time and we sat down
00:53:55 - 00:53:59: confident we're like
00:53:57 - 00:54:00: dodged the internet's going to decide to
00:53:59 - 00:54:02: hate whatever they want to hate I don't
00:54:00 - 00:54:04: really give a [ __ ] about are balling out
00:54:02 - 00:54:06: of control they're it was kind of funny
00:54:04 - 00:54:08: though because like even though it
00:54:06 - 00:54:10: wasn't fever pitch like your guys like
00:54:08 - 00:54:12: we're getting laughs throughout this bit
00:54:10 - 00:54:14: so we sat down Tom Brady was like that
00:54:12 - 00:54:17: was great he after the the Netflix
00:54:14 - 00:54:18: people the Afterparty I had to call him
00:54:17 - 00:54:20: I go do you know that like online
00:54:18 - 00:54:23: they're like you guys ate [ __ ] and I was
00:54:20 - 00:54:25: like I had no idea but do you I made
00:54:23 - 00:54:26: this point on other podcasts about
00:54:25 - 00:54:29: especially
00:54:26 - 00:54:32: about the non-comics meaning like the
00:54:29 - 00:54:34: athletes Kim Kardashian she's a great
00:54:32 - 00:54:37: example yeah uh and Ben Affleck Kim
00:54:34 - 00:54:40: Kardashian gets up there and and she's
00:54:37 - 00:54:42: getting booze right but what she does is
00:54:40 - 00:54:45: she stays unflustered stays in the
00:54:42 - 00:54:48: pocket keeps on prompt her and
00:54:45 - 00:54:49: eventually the jokes she got to jokes
00:54:48 - 00:54:51: that won the crowd over and they ended
00:54:49 - 00:54:53: up applauding and you're like wow she
00:54:51 - 00:54:56: went from there like we hate you to they
00:54:53 - 00:54:59: gave her props Ben went up there oh I
00:54:56 - 00:55:01: don't know if it was a a panic thing or
00:54:59 - 00:55:04: what but it just went yeah it went off
00:55:01 - 00:55:06: the rails no it was weird that that
00:55:04 - 00:55:09: whole that whole thing was just bizarre
00:55:06 - 00:55:11: yeah the Ben part was Goofy but it shows
00:55:09 - 00:55:12: you that it ain't easy what I think it
00:55:11 - 00:55:14: shows you it ain't easy I also think
00:55:12 - 00:55:15: that um because we didn't know he was
00:55:14 - 00:55:17: there I don't know if you knew we didn't
00:55:15 - 00:55:18: know he was there I heard a rumor that
00:55:17 - 00:55:21: he might be there so I had a couple
00:55:18 - 00:55:23: things up my sleeve but there was also
00:55:21 - 00:55:25: like you know he had a daughter that
00:55:23 - 00:55:29: just came out as trans no did you know
00:55:25 - 00:55:33: that no yeah she's like I'm a man he
00:55:29 - 00:55:35: Batman so stupid so stupid catch me
00:55:33 - 00:55:38: doing that at the next multi media roast
00:55:35 - 00:55:41: of Tom the uh no the thing is they told
00:55:38 - 00:55:44: us he was back there later on yeah with
00:55:41 - 00:55:46: writers up until I think he went on
00:55:44 - 00:55:48: which tells you that you're making last
00:55:46 - 00:55:51: minute changes which probably are
00:55:48 - 00:55:53: changes that he's suggested exactly
00:55:51 - 00:55:55: which is D very dangerous dangerous
00:55:53 - 00:55:57: what's the problem is that well and I
00:55:55 - 00:55:58: and I think you know once again I always
00:55:57 - 00:56:03: I always go back to the writers because
00:55:58 - 00:56:05: they're Mike Gibbons Mike Lawrence uh I
00:56:03 - 00:56:10: I'm thinking of the two Mike but
00:56:05 - 00:56:12: monsters they they all know so much more
00:56:10 - 00:56:14: than we do oh yeah and sometimes if you
00:56:12 - 00:56:17: don't I mean look I I see Mike Lawrence
00:56:14 - 00:56:18: and I go tell me what to say yeah he
00:56:17 - 00:56:21: gave me the Hitler joke on the on the
00:56:18 - 00:56:23: day of yeah he was like uh you know
00:56:21 - 00:56:25: Hitler stuck with his wife until the end
00:56:23 - 00:56:27: and I was like awesome can like I know
00:56:25 - 00:56:30: he is a better comic than I am he is
00:56:27 - 00:56:33: just that guy's brain is better than
00:56:30 - 00:56:34: mineer if he took his shirt off and got
00:56:33 - 00:56:39: drunk he might be have my a better
00:56:34 - 00:56:43: career than me but uh but
00:56:39 - 00:56:47: um but listen I'm I'm likable I get
00:56:43 - 00:56:48: it but uh but I think that's the the
00:56:47 - 00:56:50: problem when you get these superstars in
00:56:48 - 00:56:52: there where they go I know what I'm
00:56:50 - 00:56:54: doing right uh and I'm not going to
00:56:52 - 00:56:55: listen to Mike Lawrence or Mike Gibbons
00:56:54 - 00:56:57: or all the great writers that are
00:56:55 - 00:57:00: attached which is a very movie star
00:56:57 - 00:57:02: thing to do like got I can't I can't
00:57:00 - 00:57:04: [ __ ] on like I'm not [ __ ] on him I
00:57:02 - 00:57:06: just think that that's a decision thing
00:57:04 - 00:57:08: making adjustments to a camera angle or
00:57:06 - 00:57:10: a movie or something like that that
00:57:08 - 00:57:12: would make sense it script think what
00:57:10 - 00:57:13: did you think of his angle do you think
00:57:12 - 00:57:15: that angle could have been funny it was
00:57:13 - 00:57:17: stupid in fact it stepped on what Tom
00:57:15 - 00:57:20: was about to do later somebody should
00:57:17 - 00:57:22: have somebody should have made huge
00:57:20 - 00:57:24: adjustments to that some that's where a
00:57:22 - 00:57:25: network executive should have been like
00:57:24 - 00:57:27: wait a second this is kind of like
00:57:25 - 00:57:29: talking about internet trolls I'll tell
00:57:27 - 00:57:31: you what I think is like almost the
00:57:29 - 00:57:34: thing there is that Ben Affleck is a
00:57:31 - 00:57:36: super sharp guy yeah and I think you can
00:57:34 - 00:57:39: a really smart person who's really
00:57:36 - 00:57:43: creative you can get into overthinking
00:57:39 - 00:57:45: these things whereas like the regular
00:57:43 - 00:57:48: joke writer roast writer is like here
00:57:45 - 00:57:51: you go and they go I want to elevate
00:57:48 - 00:57:53: this more it's like it's overdoing the
00:57:51 - 00:57:57: bit and I think that's really why it
00:57:53 - 00:58:00: didn't it also just takes tons and tons
00:57:57 - 00:58:02: and tons of experience doing that like
00:58:00 - 00:58:05: even my set going back to it again like
00:58:02 - 00:58:07: it's like being raised in an all black
00:58:05 - 00:58:09: neighborhood and doing every single
00:58:07 - 00:58:11: black show that I could do when I was in
00:58:09 - 00:58:13: LA all the tripping on Tuesdays the
00:58:11 - 00:58:15: crack them up Thursdays the Metta
00:58:13 - 00:58:16: Mondays the chocolate Sundays like
00:58:15 - 00:58:19: there's all these different things what
00:58:16 - 00:58:22: they call Wednesday
00:58:19 - 00:58:26: uh never mind we hate whites Wednesday
00:58:22 - 00:58:29: no I'm kidding I don't know um but
00:58:26 - 00:58:31: uh all of that put together all of the
00:58:29 - 00:58:34: risks that I took in each one of those
00:58:31 - 00:58:38: shows was applied to what can I get away
00:58:34 - 00:58:41: with okay so I'm calling Kevin Hart a
00:58:38 - 00:58:43: shadow to gronowski I'm saying that
00:58:41 - 00:58:46: Kevin
00:58:43 - 00:58:48: Hart is so small that when his ancestors
00:58:46 - 00:58:50: picked cotton they called it deadlifting
00:58:48 - 00:58:53: I'm like o [ __ ] that's right there on
00:58:50 - 00:58:54: the line right up against it and then
00:58:53 - 00:58:56: there's definitely some of the athletes
00:58:54 - 00:58:59: on stage that were like oh well what's
00:58:56 - 00:59:02: amazing and again the [ __ ] director
00:58:59 - 00:59:05: God I'm blanking out Judy or Beth Or
00:59:02 - 00:59:07: Beth right Beth I mean my God she
00:59:05 - 00:59:10: [ __ ] got this [ __ ] and it could have
00:59:07 - 00:59:14: backfired but we did the goddamn dance
00:59:10 - 00:59:16: yes yes Beth McCarthy Miller killed it
00:59:14 - 00:59:19: so for example when I'm doing the cotton
00:59:16 - 00:59:22: picking Kevin Hart joke she literally
00:59:19 - 00:59:24: has two black offensive linemen from the
00:59:22 - 00:59:27: Tampa Bay Buccaneers over each one of my
00:59:24 - 00:59:29: shoulders and I they're literally like
00:59:27 - 00:59:32: they have their drinks and [ __ ] one of
00:59:29 - 00:59:36: them does at least and I go Kevin Hart
00:59:32 - 00:59:38: is so small that when his ancestors pick
00:59:36 - 00:59:41: cotton and at that part you see them
00:59:38 - 00:59:43: both go like and like one's taking a sip
00:59:41 - 00:59:47: like that like literally they're in over
00:59:43 - 00:59:49: my shoulders flanking me and when I hit
00:59:47 - 00:59:51: the deadlifting part you see them both
00:59:49 - 00:59:54: like one goes that way and one goes that
00:59:51 - 00:59:57: way laughing and it's like thank God how
00:59:54 - 00:59:59: many of those did you have shows I
00:59:57 - 01:00:02: imagine those shows you're talking about
00:59:59 - 01:00:04: coming up where you took a risk like
01:00:02 - 01:00:07: that and it just went horrifically wrong
01:00:04 - 01:00:09: so many so many I had one where [ __ ]
01:00:07 - 01:00:11: I went off on this one guy in an all
01:00:09 - 01:00:13: black show like I mean the super black
01:00:11 - 01:00:16: show they used to do this thing at a
01:00:13 - 01:00:19: movie theater uh at the Egyptian movie
01:00:16 - 01:00:21: theater and I mean it was it was like
01:00:19 - 01:00:24: gang gang gang gang gang gang gang La
01:00:21 - 01:00:25: gang gang gang gang Super Gang gang show
01:00:24 - 01:00:28: I cannot describe to you how dangerous
01:00:25 - 01:00:30: this show was but I was like one of
01:00:28 - 01:00:33: three token white guys that were in
01:00:30 - 01:00:37: their rotation for this thing cuz I

01:01:15 - 01:01:20: but I didn't really notice why I didn't
01:01:18 - 01:01:22: think anything of it and I'm running
01:01:20 - 01:01:25: late to my spot at the comedy store I
01:01:22 - 01:01:27: get a call from my manager on um on uh
01:01:25 - 01:01:29: speaker phone and I take it I go what's
01:01:27 - 01:01:32: up I just had a fun set at the black
01:01:29 - 01:01:37: show and he goes yeah did you just
01:01:32 - 01:01:41: completely annihilate uh ASAP Rocky I'm
01:01:37 - 01:01:43: like oh [ __ ] oh is that who that was and
01:01:41 - 01:01:45: they're like yep I just got a call from
01:01:43 - 01:01:49: one of my assistants saying that ASAP
01:01:45 - 01:01:53: Rocky is like um mad but happy but mad
01:01:49 - 01:01:55: I'm like oh [ __ ] dude this is the thing
01:01:53 - 01:01:57: there's two questions I have to ask um
01:01:55 - 01:01:59: but one is I I find really interesting
01:01:57 - 01:02:02: and I find it interesting now that your
01:01:59 - 01:02:05: name's being brought up to me so often
01:02:02 - 01:02:06: is I don't think people know who you are
01:02:05 - 01:02:10: I think when people think of you they
01:02:06 - 01:02:12: think of Hollywood La move to Austin
01:02:10 - 01:02:15: embrac the Austin Outlaw Whatchamacallit
01:02:12 - 01:02:17: but it all stems from you growing up and
01:02:15 - 01:02:20: I didn't even realize this in a rough
01:02:17 - 01:02:22: part of Ohio oh yeah the roughest and I
01:02:20 - 01:02:24: don't think Youngstown I didn't
01:02:22 - 01:02:26: understand how rough it was CU you don't
01:02:24 - 01:02:28: look like that exactly and I don't sound
01:02:26 - 01:02:30: like it a lot of that's why one of my
01:02:28 - 01:02:33: least favorite things in the world are
01:02:30 - 01:02:34: white people that try to sound black
01:02:33 - 01:02:36: that were raised in all black
01:02:34 - 01:02:39: neighborhoods cuz it's like you don't
01:02:36 - 01:02:42: have to you don't have to do that that's
01:02:39 - 01:02:44: weird cuz like no one I swear to God I I
01:02:42 - 01:02:49: wish I could show you like video like
01:02:44 - 01:02:52: like [ __ ] uh Google Maps 3D like my
01:02:49 - 01:02:55: neighborhood was so diabolically insane
01:02:52 - 01:02:57: that it's unbelievable to the human eye
01:02:55 - 01:02:59: like if if we made a movie about it no
01:02:57 - 01:03:00: one would believe it no one would
01:02:59 - 01:03:03: believe it that's what the coolest thing
01:03:00 - 01:03:05: about you is that like and so but that's
01:03:03 - 01:03:07: where the fearlessness begins so what's
01:03:05 - 01:03:10: crazy is that by the time I hit the
01:03:07 - 01:03:12: cotton picking and by the time I hit the
01:03:10 - 01:03:15: you know this the that the fearlessness
01:03:12 - 01:03:17: with him I moved to Sam J black obese
01:03:15 - 01:03:20: lesbian so Netflix checked off a lot of
01:03:17 - 01:03:23: boxes now I hit them once in the ribs
01:03:20 - 01:03:25: right Mr two minute set stay at the desk
01:03:23 - 01:03:29: we didn't want him here anyway right
01:03:25 - 01:03:31: yeah just one little one little yeah and
01:03:29 - 01:03:35: so I was
01:03:31 - 01:03:38: actually that a hell nause joke which I
01:03:35 - 01:03:41: knew the second it clicked in my head
01:03:38 - 01:03:45: like I was actually um this sounds crazy
01:03:41 - 01:03:48: but I was getting a massage at the time
01:03:45 - 01:03:50: and I trap a lot of [ __ ] my shoulders
01:03:48 - 01:03:54: this is a weird like braggadocious
01:03:50 - 01:03:56: stupid thing but like the masseuse had
01:03:54 - 01:03:58: her [ __ ] elbow right in here here and
01:03:56 - 01:04:01: I'm trying to think of a Sam J joke and
01:03:58 - 01:04:04: I'm like okay black lesbian come on Tony
01:04:01 - 01:04:07: you've got this you've got this so what
01:04:04 - 01:04:09: do they do they eat [ __ ] right but what
01:04:07 - 01:04:11: do black women say what do black women
01:04:09 - 01:04:15: say oh hell
01:04:11 - 01:04:18: no and I'm like oh my God n Nas Nas on
01:04:15 - 01:04:20: it she doesn't eat [ __ ] she all hell NS
01:04:18 - 01:04:22: on it and I stop the massage and I'm
01:04:20 - 01:04:24: literally like I got to I'm sorry I have
01:04:22 - 01:04:25: to get up and I get my face out of my
01:04:24 - 01:04:27: you know what I mean your face is
01:04:25 - 01:04:29: swollen you can't even open your eyes
01:04:27 - 01:04:31: and [ __ ] and I'm writing this down and I
01:04:29 - 01:04:35: tell the masseuse this perfect little
01:04:31 - 01:04:38: like sweet innocent right bull of a
01:04:35 - 01:04:41: chick that [ __ ] goes crazy on my
01:04:38 - 01:04:43: upper back I go I I just wrote a joke
01:04:41 - 01:04:45: about a black lesbian I said she doesn't
01:04:43 - 01:04:48: eat [ __ ] she all hell NWS on it and
01:04:45 - 01:04:50: I've never she's literally
01:04:48 - 01:04:54: like and she's not that type of person
01:04:50 - 01:04:56: like hysterically crack up and I'm like
01:04:54 - 01:04:59: oh [ __ ] this is like crazy joke like
01:04:56 - 01:05:01: it's different than it's a great joke
01:04:59 - 01:05:03: it's [ __ ] you got to go for it you
01:05:01 - 01:05:05: have to believe and if I mean another
01:05:03 - 01:05:09: super technical thing is I take a few
01:05:05 - 01:05:12: steps out I saw Drake concert like eight
01:05:09 - 01:05:13: months ago which was amazing and I kept
01:05:12 - 01:05:15: noticing that he would do this thing
01:05:13 - 01:05:17: where he would go right up to the edge
01:05:15 - 01:05:20: of the stage at times he's on a box in
01:05:17 - 01:05:22: the round and on big things and on big
01:05:20 - 01:05:24: lines it almost looked like his foot was
01:05:22 - 01:05:27: hanging off and like he was and it's a
01:05:24 - 01:05:28: high stage extra high stage too and it
01:05:27 - 01:05:30: would look like he was about to fall off
01:05:28 - 01:05:32: and I loved it sometimes I'll see like a
01:05:30 - 01:05:34: great concert or something and I'll be
01:05:32 - 01:05:36: like oh that's rocking that's good so I
01:05:34 - 01:05:38: started kind of applying that to the big
01:05:36 - 01:05:40: theater standup shows that I was doing
01:05:38 - 01:05:42: and on the AL hell NS joke I was so
01:05:40 - 01:05:45: excited and I looked down I almost fell
01:05:42 - 01:05:47: off the [ __ ] stage live on Netflix
01:05:45 - 01:05:50: because I took a few steps up I go she
01:05:47 - 01:05:52: doesn't eat [ __ ] she a like I mean I
01:05:50 - 01:05:54: literally stepped out for almost live on
01:05:52 - 01:05:57: Netflix in the middle of a killer set
01:05:54 - 01:06:00: almost disappear out of real quick

01:08:18 - 01:08:24: with these kids that are doing kill Tony
01:08:21 - 01:08:26: that are now all of a sudden so famous
01:08:24 - 01:08:29: doing these Arena shows they're very
01:08:26 - 01:08:30: talented cam Patterson I to took him on
01:08:29 - 01:08:32: the road he's one of the most enjoyable
01:08:30 - 01:08:35: human beings to be around his dad is
01:08:32 - 01:08:37: [ __ ] amazing all the time on stage
01:08:35 - 01:08:40: off stage at restaurants on the on the
01:08:37 - 01:08:43: trip everywhere but how do you keep it
01:08:40 - 01:08:46: measured for them to let them know yo
01:08:43 - 01:08:48: you still just started this is a long
01:08:46 - 01:08:51: career and you're getting so [ __ ]

01:08:59 - 01:09:05: to them and like like Joe talked to us
01:09:02 - 01:09:06: or or to to keep the measure to go hey

01:09:06 - 01:09:10: to be a long career and it's it's not
01:09:08 - 01:09:13: always going to be as fire hot as it is
01:09:10 - 01:09:15: right now and like cuz that's the most
01:09:13 - 01:09:17: fascinating thing it's the secret sauce
01:09:15 - 01:09:19: to my life it's the thing that actually
01:09:17 - 01:09:23: keeps everything in Balance I don't have
01:09:19 - 01:09:26: kids I don't have you know a wife I uh

01:09:30 - 01:09:37: I love comedy so much I live it and
01:09:33 - 01:09:40: breathe it and so my favorite thing is

01:09:40 - 01:09:47: know kill Tony
01:09:42 - 01:09:50: is a it's it's it's actually modeled
