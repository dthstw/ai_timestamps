00:00:20 - 00:00:24: panel President Joe Biden had just one
00:00:22 - 00:00:27: simple job in last night's debate to
00:00:24 - 00:00:29: convince America that he's fit to serve
00:00:27 - 00:00:30: the bar was set at ankle height but the
00:00:29 - 00:00:35: president president tripped straight
00:00:30 - 00:00:37: over him he faltered he mumbled he lost
00:00:35 - 00:00:39: and his race must surely now be over for
00:00:37 - 00:00:41: the good of democracy and his country
00:00:39 - 00:00:43: there were so many toe curling incidents
00:00:41 - 00:00:45: in last night's debate we'll analyze and
00:00:43 - 00:00:47: dissect them in detail but the defining
00:00:45 - 00:00:49: moment the moment they're calling the
00:00:47 - 00:00:54: killshot was
00:00:49 - 00:00:56: this total ban on the the the total
00:00:54 - 00:00:59: initiative relative to what we can do
00:00:56 - 00:01:00: with more border patrol and more Asylum
00:00:59 - 00:01:02: officers
00:01:00 - 00:01:04: president Trump I really don't know what
00:01:02 - 00:01:05: he said at the end of that sentence I
00:01:04 - 00:01:08: don't think he knows what he said
00:01:05 - 00:01:09: either I don't think anyone did for
00:01:08 - 00:01:11: possibly the first time ever in a TV
00:01:09 - 00:01:13: event starring Donald Trump no one's
00:01:11 - 00:01:14: talking about Donald Trump today and for
00:01:13 - 00:01:17: the first time ever that will suit him
00:01:14 - 00:01:18: just fine Republicans brief for weeks
00:01:17 - 00:01:20: President Biden will be on drugs for
00:01:18 - 00:01:22: this debate but if you took anything at
00:01:20 - 00:01:24: all last night it was surely Valium for
00:01:22 - 00:01:26: all the spin about cheap fakes and
00:01:24 - 00:01:28: Biden's secret Vigor this was a chance
00:01:26 - 00:01:30: for the American people to judge their
00:01:28 - 00:01:31: president for themselves and to the
00:01:30 - 00:01:34: palpable distress and dismay of
00:01:31 - 00:01:36: Democrats everywhere it was really all
00:01:34 - 00:01:39: over in the first
00:01:36 - 00:01:39: minute
00:01:43 - 00:01:51: are great to be here thank
00:01:46 - 00:01:54: you the $15 for for a incident shot as
00:01:51 - 00:01:57: opposed to $400 no Senor has to pay more
00:01:54 - 00:02:00: than $200 for any drug all the drugs
00:01:57 - 00:02:02: they can include beginning next year in
00:02:00 - 00:02:03: a situation is make and we're going to
00:02:02 - 00:02:05: make that available to everybody to all
00:02:03 - 00:02:07: Americans so we're working to bring down
00:02:05 - 00:02:09: the price of around the kitchen table
00:02:07 - 00:02:11: and that's what we're going to get
00:02:09 - 00:02:13: done I didn't understand a word of that
00:02:11 - 00:02:15: did you it couldn't really get much
00:02:13 - 00:02:17: worse of Biden after that but it well
00:02:15 - 00:02:19: certainly didn't get any better it just
00:02:17 - 00:02:21: carried on that way uh Trump was
00:02:19 - 00:02:22: disciplined and measured by his own
00:02:21 - 00:02:25: standards all he had to do was really
00:02:22 - 00:02:27: let Biden fall into his own traps and
00:02:25 - 00:02:30: his facial expressions alone were enough
00:02:27 - 00:02:32: to win the contest Trump looked how we
00:02:30 - 00:02:33: all felt at home watching bewildered
00:02:32 - 00:02:35: that the man standing opposite is the
00:02:33 - 00:02:37: most powerful man in the world the
00:02:35 - 00:02:39: president of the United States the
00:02:37 - 00:02:42: leader of the Free World Biden just
00:02:39 - 00:02:44: looked bewildered there wasn't a great
00:02:42 - 00:02:46: deal of substance or policy in fact the
00:02:44 - 00:02:48: most heated debate was about which of
00:02:46 - 00:02:51: the two candidates is better at
00:02:48 - 00:02:53: golf to do that you have to be quite
00:02:51 - 00:02:55: smart and you have to be able to hit the
00:02:53 - 00:02:57: ball a long way and I do it he doesn't
00:02:55 - 00:02:59: do it he can't hit a ball 50 yards he
00:02:57 - 00:03:02: challenged me to a golf match he can't
00:02:59 - 00:03:07: hit a ball 50 yards you can see he is
00:03:02 - 00:03:09: 6'5 and only 223 lb or 2035 lb I told
00:03:07 - 00:03:13: you before I'm happy to play golf if you
00:03:09 - 00:03:16: carry your own bag think you can do
00:03:13 - 00:03:18: it president Trump we're going to let's
00:03:16 - 00:03:20: not act like
00:03:18 - 00:03:22: children the last thing we'd want is to
00:03:20 - 00:03:24: see anyone act like children right
00:03:22 - 00:03:26: Donald I I said this morning if Biden's
00:03:24 - 00:03:28: handicap at gol is six and I'm the
00:03:26 - 00:03:29: Archbishop of Canterbury but probably
00:03:28 - 00:03:31: the biggest disaster of all for the
00:03:29 - 00:03:33: president was his closing statement
00:03:31 - 00:03:35: which he's been locked away rehearsing
00:03:33 - 00:03:38: remember for an entire
00:03:35 - 00:03:41: week we've made significant progress
00:03:38 - 00:03:44: from the debacle that was left by
00:03:41 - 00:03:46: President Trump in in in his last term
00:03:44 - 00:03:50: he wants to get away with he get rid of
00:03:46 - 00:03:53: the ability of Medicare to for the
00:03:50 - 00:03:55: ability to for the US to be able to
00:03:53 - 00:03:59: negotiate drug pric with the big Pharma
00:03:55 - 00:04:02: companies well guess what we got it we
00:03:59 - 00:04:04: got it down 15 excuse me $35 I'm going
00:04:02 - 00:04:07: to make sure we do something about what
00:04:04 - 00:04:09: we're doing on lead pipes and all the
00:04:07 - 00:04:11: things that are causing health problems
00:04:09 - 00:04:13: for people across the country we're
00:04:11 - 00:04:16: going to continue to fight to bring down
00:04:13 - 00:04:16: inflation and give people a break thank
00:04:16 - 00:04:19: you
00:04:16 - 00:04:21: president completely excruciating I've
00:04:19 - 00:04:23: never seen the switch on mainstream
00:04:21 - 00:04:25: opinion flip so hard and so fast all of
00:04:23 - 00:04:28: the attention is now shifting to whether
00:04:25 - 00:04:30: the Democrats can replace Biden before
00:04:28 - 00:04:33: November's election otherwise surely
00:04:30 - 00:04:34: they're facing an absolute drubbing the
00:04:33 - 00:04:36: simplest and most dignified ways for
00:04:34 - 00:04:38: President Biden to stand down as a
00:04:36 - 00:04:40: manner of Honor pride and integrity and
00:04:38 - 00:04:43: I believe he has all those qualities he
00:04:40 - 00:04:45: needs to make that decision and make it
00:04:43 - 00:04:46: fast another Main Event it's time for
00:04:45 - 00:04:48: the uncensored debate we're going to
00:04:46 - 00:04:50: hear from Allstar cast of characters
00:04:48 - 00:04:52: over the next hour from Carrie Lake to
00:04:50 - 00:04:54: Harry Sison Kevin o and more but first
00:04:52 - 00:04:56: I'll introduce our box office panel
00:04:54 - 00:04:58: podcaster and commentator Vinnie Asana
00:04:56 - 00:05:01: founder of The Young Turks C Yuga
00:04:58 - 00:05:03: Trump's former lawyer jenet Ellis and
00:05:01 - 00:05:05: twitch streamer Hassan perer well
00:05:03 - 00:05:07: welcome to all of you let me start with
00:05:05 - 00:05:11: you CH because you and I have talked
00:05:07 - 00:05:14: about this many times about Joe Biden's
00:05:11 - 00:05:17: mental and physical ability to be fit to
00:05:14 - 00:05:19: serve the most powerful and important
00:05:17 - 00:05:21: office in the country as you were
00:05:19 - 00:05:23: watching last night's debate what was
00:05:21 - 00:05:27: going through your
00:05:23 - 00:05:28: mind I was right um so I as you know I
00:05:27 - 00:05:30: took an extraordinary step of running
00:05:28 - 00:05:32: for president against Joe Biden the
00:05:30 - 00:05:34: Democratic primary even though I'm not
00:05:32 - 00:05:37: even a natural born citizen uh because
00:05:34 - 00:05:39: that's how desperate I was our audience
00:05:37 - 00:05:42: was we did a poll and we asked our
00:05:39 - 00:05:44: paying members should I run and not and
00:05:42 - 00:05:46: now nine months ago 76% of them said for
00:05:44 - 00:05:49: God's sake run do you know why because
00:05:46 - 00:05:52: it was obvious and what I took away from
00:05:49 - 00:05:54: it peers and what's what everyone should
00:05:52 - 00:05:57: remember is how much Democratic
00:05:54 - 00:06:00: Leadership lied to you and how much
00:05:57 - 00:06:02: everyone in mainstream media Li lied to
00:06:00 - 00:06:04: you they said the emperor had clothes
00:06:02 - 00:06:06: when it was obvious that he had no
00:06:04 - 00:06:08: clothes they said that he was perfectly
00:06:06 - 00:06:11: fine and he was a Dynamo behind the
00:06:08 - 00:06:13: scenes how Preposterous we were write
00:06:11 - 00:06:15: all along so the next time they tell you
00:06:13 - 00:06:17: you got to vote for Joe Biden or Hillary
00:06:15 - 00:06:19: Clinton in a primary because they're the
00:06:17 - 00:06:23: only ones who can win remember this
00:06:19 - 00:06:25: Preposterous lie remember how terribly
00:06:23 - 00:06:27: they deceived you into picking the
00:06:25 - 00:06:29: weakest candidate not the strongest
00:06:27 - 00:06:31: candidate and peers every time I said
00:06:29 - 00:06:33: let's pick someone stronger so that we
00:06:31 - 00:06:35: can beat Trump they said oh you want oh
00:06:33 - 00:06:39: so you like Trump you want to help Trump
00:06:35 - 00:06:41: no you picked the strongest person so
00:06:39 - 00:06:43: you can beat Trump and apparently they
00:06:41 - 00:06:45: couldn't understand simple Concepts like
00:06:43 - 00:06:47: that but now the whole world has seen
00:06:45 - 00:06:49: what we saw all along you know CH before
00:06:47 - 00:06:52: we go to the other three there are
00:06:49 - 00:06:55: reports uh as we're talking now that
00:06:52 - 00:06:58: Barack Obama has been having urgent
00:06:55 - 00:07:01: conversations with Joe Biden to try and
00:06:58 - 00:07:03: gently persuade him it maybe time to
00:07:01 - 00:07:06: give up uh but apparently Jill Biden is
00:07:03 - 00:07:08: resisting wants him to fight on kamla
00:07:06 - 00:07:10: Harris is enraged that her name is not
00:07:08 - 00:07:12: in the conversation to potentially
00:07:10 - 00:07:14: replace him people want to bypass her
00:07:12 - 00:07:16: completely because she's even more
00:07:14 - 00:07:19: unpopular than he is uh and move to
00:07:16 - 00:07:21: somebody like Gavin Yim or or someone
00:07:19 - 00:07:23: like that um what is the what is the
00:07:21 - 00:07:25: Playbook here well are we into
00:07:23 - 00:07:27: unprecedented territory because I don't
00:07:25 - 00:07:31: think any incumbent president in
00:07:27 - 00:07:34: American history who is seeking to be
00:07:31 - 00:07:36: reelected and hasn't stood down uh has
00:07:34 - 00:07:38: ever been forced out there's no
00:07:36 - 00:07:40: mechanism to actually force him out
00:07:38 - 00:07:42: unless he voluntarily goes is
00:07:40 - 00:07:46: it yeah there is one mechanism
00:07:42 - 00:07:48: unfortunately and it's the donors uh
00:07:46 - 00:07:50: because once the donors stop funding him
00:07:48 - 00:07:52: uh then he'll have no oxygen left
00:07:50 - 00:07:55: remember for someone who's a populist
00:07:52 - 00:07:57: Like Bernie Sanders their source of
00:07:55 - 00:07:59: power is the people but for people like
00:07:57 - 00:08:01: Biden who are establishment candidates
00:07:59 - 00:08:05: there source of power is money and once
00:08:01 - 00:08:07: the money tap is turned off then he's
00:08:05 - 00:08:10: got no oxygen left so I don't care what
00:08:07 - 00:08:12: Jill Biden thinks are you like who's
00:08:10 - 00:08:14: insane enough to care what she thinks I
00:08:12 - 00:08:16: don't care what kamla Harris thinks I
00:08:14 - 00:08:19: care about picking the strongest
00:08:16 - 00:08:22: candidate against Trump is democracy on
00:08:19 - 00:08:24: the line or isn't it is is this the most
00:08:22 - 00:08:26: important election of our lifetime or
00:08:24 - 00:08:29: isn't it so now they're talking about oh
00:08:26 - 00:08:31: whose personality should we care more
00:08:29 - 00:08:33: about who whose feelings are more
00:08:31 - 00:08:35: important none of your feelings are
00:08:33 - 00:08:37: important what's important is that the
00:08:35 - 00:08:39: American people be safe from Donald
00:08:37 - 00:08:41: Trump and let's be honest Democratic
00:08:39 - 00:08:44: Leadership has never cared about that
00:08:41 - 00:08:46: and peers let's tell your audience why
00:08:44 - 00:08:48: because remember almost everyone on
00:08:46 - 00:08:50: Biden's team at the White House on his
00:08:48 - 00:08:52: campaign at the Democratic National
00:08:50 - 00:08:54: Committee their jobs are tied to Joe
00:08:52 - 00:08:57: Biden if there's a new candidate they
00:08:54 - 00:09:00: all get fired so they have been
00:08:57 - 00:09:02: enormously monstrously selfish
00:09:00 - 00:09:04: saying I don't care if the country Burns
00:09:02 - 00:09:06: as long as I get to keep my job they
00:09:04 - 00:09:07: betrayed you greatly and you should
00:09:06 - 00:09:10: never listen to them again okay let me
00:09:07 - 00:09:15: bring in some of the others um Hass p i
00:09:10 - 00:09:17: mean you'd have to be willfully
00:09:15 - 00:09:19: negligent with regard to what you saw
00:09:17 - 00:09:21: with your own eyes wouldn't you to watch
00:09:19 - 00:09:25: that debate last night and not conclude
00:09:21 - 00:09:27: as so many Biden supporters and friends
00:09:25 - 00:09:29: have publicly concluded this is from you
00:09:27 - 00:09:31: know people like uh Frank bru at the New
00:09:29 - 00:09:33: York Times and others who just come out
00:09:31 - 00:09:36: and said you've got to stand down did
00:09:33 - 00:09:38: you see anything last night that would
00:09:36 - 00:09:42: allow you to construct an argument that
00:09:38 - 00:09:42: he should continue and be the
00:09:42 - 00:09:48: nominee Biden continuing absolutely not
00:09:45 - 00:09:49: but um there's another glaringly obvious
00:09:48 - 00:09:52: problem here Jen and I have had this
00:09:49 - 00:09:54: conversation personally uh for years at
00:09:52 - 00:09:56: this point very publicly about Biden
00:09:54 - 00:09:58: being ineligible to run and how he's
00:09:56 - 00:10:00: going to lead to the downfall of the
00:09:58 - 00:10:03: democratic party and and potentially
00:10:00 - 00:10:05: lose a pretty easy to win election
00:10:03 - 00:10:07: against Donald Trump at this point and
00:10:05 - 00:10:09: we were absolutely right and it was
00:10:07 - 00:10:10: shocking that so many in the media who
00:10:09 - 00:10:13: are now writing those articles that
00:10:10 - 00:10:15: you're talking about were acting as
00:10:13 - 00:10:16: though Biden was actually a Dynamo
00:10:15 - 00:10:20: behind the scenes after I mean there was
00:10:16 - 00:10:21: literally an article I remember uh uh
00:10:20 - 00:10:24: from an excerpt from a Jill steinbook
00:10:21 - 00:10:27: about how uh in order to soften the blow
00:10:24 - 00:10:29: of Biden's uh Age and and how old and
00:10:27 - 00:10:31: scile he's appearing on television they
00:10:29 - 00:10:33: were saying that he had really hard sex
00:10:31 - 00:10:35: with his wife I mean that's to the
00:10:33 - 00:10:37: extent that these guys went to in order
00:10:35 - 00:10:41: to try and manufacture this narrative
00:10:37 - 00:10:43: and to anyone with eyes and ears to hear
00:10:41 - 00:10:45: they could see what Biden uh looked like
00:10:43 - 00:10:47: what Biden's performance looked like so
00:10:45 - 00:10:51: I don't understand why it's so shocking
00:10:47 - 00:10:53: to people David Axelrod said on CNN uh I
00:10:51 - 00:10:55: believe at this point eight months ago
00:10:53 - 00:10:59: nine months ago that you know Biden has
00:10:55 - 00:11:00: to go someone else has to come in uh and
00:10:59 - 00:11:05: and you know potentially win this race
00:11:00 - 00:11:07: you have an election coming up right now
00:11:05 - 00:11:11: where the down ballot races where you
00:11:07 - 00:11:13: have Democratic party Senators doing 10
00:11:11 - 00:11:15: points better than the top of the ticket
00:11:13 - 00:11:17: than Joe Biden in places like Nevada and
00:11:15 - 00:11:20: in States like Arizona these are states
00:11:17 - 00:11:22: that Biden has to win you have uh issues
00:11:20 - 00:11:24: especially post October 7 with the
00:11:22 - 00:11:26: supposed blue wall That's obviously
00:11:24 - 00:11:28: destroyed you got Michigan that's a m
00:11:26 - 00:11:31: that's that's a potential problem for
00:11:28 - 00:11:33: Joe Biden all these swing states that uh
00:11:31 - 00:11:37: the Democratic party should be clearing
00:11:33 - 00:11:41: up with like Reagan numbers uh right now
00:11:37 - 00:11:44: are in contest having said that um
00:11:41 - 00:11:45: Donald Trump also had a phenomenally bad
00:11:44 - 00:11:47: performance last night it's just that no
00:11:45 - 00:11:49: one is going to talk about that because
00:11:47 - 00:11:50: one guy was very clearly demented so
00:11:49 - 00:11:52: when the other guy's talking about
00:11:50 - 00:11:55: immigrants and and how they're
00:11:52 - 00:11:57: responsible for everything that is going
00:11:55 - 00:11:59: on for an hour and 30 minutes straight
00:11:57 - 00:12:00: people didn't even have the time to make
00:11:59 - 00:12:03: make that assessment because they were
00:12:00 - 00:12:07: so unimaginably shocked at the fact that
00:12:03 - 00:12:09: the Democratic party has basically put
00:12:07 - 00:12:12: forward a kadaver and tried to push him
00:12:09 - 00:12:16: over the Finish Line uh and and are
00:12:12 - 00:12:17: hoping that you don't notice okay I'm
00:12:16 - 00:12:18: going to come to the two panelists in a
00:12:17 - 00:12:20: moment going to be joined right now
00:12:18 - 00:12:23: though by the Republican US Senate
00:12:20 - 00:12:26: candidate for Arizona Carrie Lake um
00:12:23 - 00:12:29: Carrie what did we watch last
00:12:26 - 00:12:32: night a train wreck combined with a
00:12:29 - 00:12:34: dumpster fire and a huge massive victory
00:12:32 - 00:12:36: for president Trump and and really uh
00:12:34 - 00:12:38: America first that's what it's about
00:12:36 - 00:12:39: it's about putting our country first and
00:12:38 - 00:12:43: we've watched for four years as Joe
00:12:39 - 00:12:45: Biden has uh caused the most uh high
00:12:43 - 00:12:47: levels of inflation that I've seen in my
00:12:45 - 00:12:49: lifetime we've watched and I'm not just
00:12:47 - 00:12:51: going to blame Joe Biden the Democrat
00:12:49 - 00:12:54: the national Democrats have stood behind
00:12:51 - 00:12:56: this guy and to act like last night oh
00:12:54 - 00:12:58: my goodness finally they're just seeing
00:12:56 - 00:13:00: for the first time there's problems with
00:12:58 - 00:13:02: Joe Biden we've been seeing this for a
00:13:00 - 00:13:05: long time pierce the American people
00:13:02 - 00:13:08: have been seeing his decline for a long
00:13:05 - 00:13:10: time and I think we need to all come
00:13:08 - 00:13:12: together at this moment in history and
00:13:10 - 00:13:14: recognize that there's we need to make a
00:13:12 - 00:13:17: major major change that debate
00:13:14 - 00:13:19: performance was a debacle we cannot
00:13:17 - 00:13:22: trust the national Democrats or the
00:13:19 - 00:13:23: mainstream media none of them especially
00:13:22 - 00:13:26: not the guy I'm running against Ruben
00:13:23 - 00:13:28: gyo he's been part and parcel voted 100%
00:13:26 - 00:13:30: of the time with Joe Biden and they've
00:13:28 - 00:13:32: allowed him to spend four years
00:13:30 - 00:13:35: destroying our country they haven't
00:13:32 - 00:13:37: lifted a single finger and now after all
00:13:35 - 00:13:40: the inflation uh 20 million people
00:13:37 - 00:13:42: invading our country the disastrous
00:13:40 - 00:13:44: disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan
00:13:42 - 00:13:47: Russia's invasion of Ukraine terrorist
00:13:44 - 00:13:49: attack October 7th I could go on and on
00:13:47 - 00:13:52: and on now they're starting to criticize
00:13:49 - 00:13:53: Biden I don't know I'm just not buying
00:13:52 - 00:13:57: it I'm I'm
00:13:53 - 00:13:59: just be could it be care be careful what
00:13:57 - 00:14:01: you wish for in the sense that what at
00:13:59 - 00:14:03: the moment is obviously a spectacularly
00:14:01 - 00:14:06: good day to be Donald Trump because
00:14:03 - 00:14:08: nobody's talking about him other than by
00:14:06 - 00:14:11: comparison to Biden he was a sort of
00:14:08 - 00:14:13: Whirlwind of dynamism and youthful vigor
00:14:11 - 00:14:16: and energy but of course Biden was so
00:14:13 - 00:14:18: bad that there's now a concerted effort
00:14:16 - 00:14:21: you can feel it from the ma mainstream
00:14:18 - 00:14:24: media to Democrat supporters to donors
00:14:21 - 00:14:26: and so on to try and force Joe Biden to
00:14:24 - 00:14:29: to give up if that was to happen and the
00:14:26 - 00:14:31: Democrats were to parachute in a much
00:14:29 - 00:14:33: younger much more Dynamic person maybe
00:14:31 - 00:14:36: somebody a lot younger than Donald Trump
00:14:33 - 00:14:39: could that actually be bad news in the
00:14:36 - 00:14:41: in the longer term of this election
00:14:39 - 00:14:43: race well first of all I think the
00:14:41 - 00:14:45: Democrats are stuck with Joe Biden I
00:14:43 - 00:14:47: don't see a way out at this point you
00:14:45 - 00:14:49: know the money he's raised would have to
00:14:47 - 00:14:51: stay with him they wouldn't be able to
00:14:49 - 00:14:53: transfer that over and you know honestly
00:14:51 - 00:14:55: I don't think you can bring anybody in I
00:14:53 - 00:14:58: mean you you could bring someone younger
00:14:55 - 00:15:00: in they still have destructive policies
00:14:58 - 00:15:02: Piers this is is n just Joe Biden it's
00:15:00 - 00:15:05: the Democrat policies which are not
00:15:02 - 00:15:08: Democrat policies of yester year this is
00:15:05 - 00:15:12: a new wave of of socialism hinging on
00:15:08 - 00:15:13: Marxism this is an open border changing
00:15:12 - 00:15:15: the pers changing the entire
00:15:13 - 00:15:18: demographics of our country this is a
00:15:15 - 00:15:20: deadend economy this is crime on the
00:15:18 - 00:15:23: streets this is the uh you know
00:15:20 - 00:15:25: indoctrination of our children no matter
00:15:23 - 00:15:27: who you plug into that it's still the
00:15:25 - 00:15:29: policies of the Democrat Party that
00:15:27 - 00:15:32: don't work for everyday Americans I
00:15:29 - 00:15:34: think what we saw last night was America
00:15:32 - 00:15:36: collectively coming together saying we
00:15:34 - 00:15:39: want president Trump back in the white
00:15:36 - 00:15:41: house he can turn this around give us a
00:15:39 - 00:15:45: great strong economy Safe Streets once
00:15:41 - 00:15:46: again a secure border World Peace who
00:15:45 - 00:15:48: doesn't want
00:15:46 - 00:15:50: that there was factchecking going on
00:15:48 - 00:15:53: with both the candidates and a lot of
00:15:50 - 00:15:55: the statements that Donald Trump made uh
00:15:53 - 00:15:58: were fact checked to be untrue or
00:15:55 - 00:15:59: exaggerated but so were many of Joe
00:15:58 - 00:16:01: Biden
00:15:59 - 00:16:05: and although you say he's going to carry
00:16:01 - 00:16:07: on with the ticket surely if that was
00:16:05 - 00:16:09: your candidate you would want that
00:16:07 - 00:16:10: candidate removed it isn't that exactly
00:16:09 - 00:16:12: what's going to happen here I mean you
00:16:10 - 00:16:13: say it can't be done it can be done
00:16:12 - 00:16:15: there's still five months to the
00:16:13 - 00:16:17: election why wouldn't they try and get
00:16:15 - 00:16:20: rid of Biden
00:16:17 - 00:16:21: now well if that were my candidate I'd
00:16:20 - 00:16:23: be switching parties right away and
00:16:21 - 00:16:25: going to the party that wants to
00:16:23 - 00:16:27: actually do something for the American
00:16:25 - 00:16:29: people let's remember that when
00:16:27 - 00:16:31: President Trump if if if not for the
00:16:29 - 00:16:33: media the entire country would have been
00:16:31 - 00:16:36: behind him we had an incredible economy
00:16:33 - 00:16:38: as I said a secure border we didn't have
00:16:36 - 00:16:39: people pouring across our border
00:16:38 - 00:16:41: committing heinous crimes on the
00:16:39 - 00:16:43: American people you know killing a
00:16:41 - 00:16:45: mother of five children leaving her dead
00:16:43 - 00:16:47: and those five children to be orphans
00:16:45 - 00:16:50: that was an illegal who came across her
00:16:47 - 00:16:53: border because Joe Biden opened it up so
00:16:50 - 00:16:56: if if if people who went into the debate
00:16:53 - 00:16:59: last night wanting to vote for Joe Biden
00:16:56 - 00:17:00: I say to them come on over to the
00:16:59 - 00:17:03: America first party let's put our
00:17:00 - 00:17:06: country first let's turn this thing
00:17:03 - 00:17:08: around and bring back uh sanity let's
00:17:06 - 00:17:10: bring back a strong economy let's bring
00:17:08 - 00:17:13: back Safety and Security on our streets
00:17:10 - 00:17:15: you don't have to be tied down to the
00:17:13 - 00:17:17: Democrat Party anymore let's just start
00:17:15 - 00:17:19: putting our country first so when we do
00:17:17 - 00:17:21: that I think we're going to see a huge
00:17:19 - 00:17:23: turnaround rather quickly here in
00:17:21 - 00:17:25: America and prosperity and Safety and
00:17:23 - 00:17:27: Security for all Carrie Lake thank you
00:17:25 - 00:17:29: very much for joining me I appreciate
00:17:27 - 00:17:31: it thank you let's go back to the panel
00:17:29 - 00:17:33: I want to talk to Jenna Ellis now Jenna
00:17:31 - 00:17:35: you're a former lawyer to Donald Trump
00:17:33 - 00:17:38: you you pretty guilty in the election
00:17:35 - 00:17:40: subversion case in Georgia in October
00:17:38 - 00:17:41: you were the fourth of 19 codefendants
00:17:40 - 00:17:43: to plead guilty in a deal with
00:17:41 - 00:17:44: prosecutors Trump of course has has
00:17:43 - 00:17:48: pleaded not guilty so that's the
00:17:44 - 00:17:50: background to your appearance today um
00:17:48 - 00:17:52: look Trump you know was Trump I mean I
00:17:50 - 00:17:54: just looked at them both uh I watched
00:17:52 - 00:17:55: the whole debate from start to finish
00:17:54 - 00:17:58: without without any break and I just saw
00:17:55 - 00:18:00: in Trump the same guy that I've known
00:17:58 - 00:18:01: pretty much for 20 years looking and
00:18:00 - 00:18:03: behaving frankly the same way he's
00:18:01 - 00:18:06: always behaved if anything he was
00:18:03 - 00:18:08: slightly less combative and
00:18:06 - 00:18:09: confrontational than he normally is he
00:18:08 - 00:18:12: was a bit more on message than he
00:18:09 - 00:18:14: normally is um he was fact checked he
00:18:12 - 00:18:17: did tell a number of untruths but when
00:18:14 - 00:18:19: you've got an opponent like Joe Biden if
00:18:17 - 00:18:20: he continues to be the opponent surely
00:18:19 - 00:18:23: Donald Trump is just heading straight
00:18:20 - 00:18:26: back to the White House isn't
00:18:23 - 00:18:28: he well I've said for a while that the
00:18:26 - 00:18:30: first party that is willing to
00:18:28 - 00:18:32: substitute suit either Trump or Biden is
00:18:30 - 00:18:35: likely to be the Victor because you have
00:18:32 - 00:18:37: people on both sides that absolutely
00:18:35 - 00:18:39: hate Donald Trump and absolutely hate
00:18:37 - 00:18:41: Joe Biden and after last night and Trump
00:18:39 - 00:18:44: was clearly the winner just because he
00:18:41 - 00:18:46: was able to be coherent and measured and
00:18:44 - 00:18:48: show leadership and that's a really low
00:18:46 - 00:18:51: standard uh after last night what you
00:18:48 - 00:18:54: really saw Piers was the Washington
00:18:51 - 00:18:56: corruption on full display because we
00:18:54 - 00:18:59: have been lied to by the White House by
00:18:56 - 00:19:00: democrats by the media who have continue
00:18:59 - 00:19:01: to prop up Joe Biden and say there's
00:19:00 - 00:19:03: nothing wrong with him he's perfectly
00:19:01 - 00:19:06: capable of course he's running the White
00:19:03 - 00:19:09: House kamla Harris herself in that very
00:19:06 - 00:19:11: just shocking interview with Anderson
00:19:09 - 00:19:13: Cooper right after couldn't even answer
00:19:11 - 00:19:15: the question his last question to her of
00:19:13 - 00:19:17: whether this is the same Joe Biden that
00:19:15 - 00:19:18: she sees every day because she can't
00:19:17 - 00:19:21: answer what is the response to that if
00:19:18 - 00:19:24: she says yes then that's really bad for
00:19:21 - 00:19:27: her if she says no then she's admitting
00:19:24 - 00:19:29: that he is not fit for office but on the
00:19:27 - 00:19:31: same hand if there is a replacement and
00:19:29 - 00:19:32: I think that the Democrats are right to
00:19:31 - 00:19:34: push for that then I think that that
00:19:32 - 00:19:37: ultimately does hurt Donald Trump in the
00:19:34 - 00:19:40: long run and even Republican friends of
00:19:37 - 00:19:41: mine and people who uh who I worked with
00:19:40 - 00:19:44: on the 2020 campaign who've been there
00:19:41 - 00:19:47: since 2016 don't support Donald Trump
00:19:44 - 00:19:50: anymore and for very good reason and so
00:19:47 - 00:19:52: if Joe Biden is replaced then I think
00:19:50 - 00:19:54: that this debate will have been a
00:19:52 - 00:19:56: mistake for Donald Trump to have
00:19:54 - 00:19:59: participated in because he may end up
00:19:56 - 00:20:03: losing if they do replace Joe Biden and
00:19:59 - 00:20:06: I think we have to remember that now in
00:20:03 - 00:20:09: America our entire election system is
00:20:06 - 00:20:11: run by a two-party ultimately corrupt
00:20:09 - 00:20:13: system this isn't of the People by the
00:20:11 - 00:20:16: people for the people that are founders
00:20:13 - 00:20:18: intended this is a a two-party system
00:20:16 - 00:20:20: that needs each other that feeds off
00:20:18 - 00:20:22: each other and is both thoroughly
00:20:20 - 00:20:25: corrupt and I think that we all As
00:20:22 - 00:20:27: Americans need to take a very hard look
00:20:25 - 00:20:29: at our Republic the path forward and ask
00:20:27 - 00:20:32: ourselves why we're these the two
00:20:29 - 00:20:34: candidates on the debate stage as an
00:20:32 - 00:20:36: independent now unaffiliated I supported
00:20:34 - 00:20:38: Governor DeSantis in the primary because
00:20:36 - 00:20:40: I've seen the corruption out of the
00:20:38 - 00:20:42: Trump side and I have very serious
00:20:40 - 00:20:44: concerns about him going back into the
00:20:42 - 00:20:46: White House and I wish that the
00:20:44 - 00:20:48: Republicans would have a long
00:20:46 - 00:20:50: conversation about their convention but
00:20:48 - 00:20:52: I think that that is going to happen for
00:20:50 - 00:20:55: the Democrats and they're wise to do
00:20:52 - 00:20:57: that openly and publicly now but we have
00:20:55 - 00:20:59: to remember they are the ones that have
00:20:57 - 00:21:01: lied to us about B 's mental capacity
00:20:59 - 00:21:04: and there is another way to take him out
00:21:01 - 00:21:06: if his cabinet members a number of them
00:21:04 - 00:21:08: uh a sufficient number of the majority
00:21:06 - 00:21:10: per the 255th Amendment and it's not
00:21:08 - 00:21:12: about unfit it's not about policy it's
00:21:10 - 00:21:15: not about liking him or not the term
00:21:12 - 00:21:18: constitutionally is unable to fulfill
00:21:15 - 00:21:20: his duties he clearly is unable if they
00:21:18 - 00:21:22: stood up and actually said that they
00:21:20 - 00:21:23: could they could take him out BR okay
00:21:22 - 00:21:25: just bring in Vinnie asan I want to play
00:21:23 - 00:21:29: a little clip this is of Gavin Nim uh
00:21:25 - 00:21:31: speaking last night
00:21:29 - 00:21:34: there is panic do you think it's
00:21:31 - 00:21:37: unfounded well I think it's unhelpful uh
00:21:34 - 00:21:39: and I think it's unnecessary uh we've
00:21:37 - 00:21:41: got to go in we got to keep our heads
00:21:39 - 00:21:42: high and as I say we've got to have the
00:21:41 - 00:21:45: back of this President you don't turn
00:21:42 - 00:21:47: your back because of one performance
00:21:45 - 00:21:50: what kind of party does that it's been a
00:21:47 - 00:21:51: master class 15.6 million uh uh jobs
00:21:50 - 00:21:53: that's eight times more than the last
00:21:51 - 00:21:54: three Republican presidents combined the
00:21:53 - 00:21:56: only thing the last three Republican
00:21:54 - 00:21:58: presidents have in common is recessions
00:21:56 - 00:22:01: Democrats deliver this president and
00:21:58 - 00:22:05: it's delivered we need to deliver for
00:22:01 - 00:22:07: him now Vinnie here's the thing uh Trump
00:22:05 - 00:22:11: had a great night I mean even the CNN
00:22:07 - 00:22:13: poll 67% of CNN viewers felt that Trump
00:22:11 - 00:22:16: put in a better performance than 33% for
00:22:13 - 00:22:18: Biden God knows who the 33% were but um
00:22:16 - 00:22:20: he obviously won the debate very
00:22:18 - 00:22:22: comfortably just by just not doing very
00:22:20 - 00:22:24: much particularly special um but if they
00:22:22 - 00:22:27: do get rid of Biden and they do
00:22:24 - 00:22:29: parachute in somebody like Gavin Nome
00:22:27 - 00:22:31: who's young he's dynamic he's not afraid
00:22:29 - 00:22:33: to get into the horses into the lion's
00:22:31 - 00:22:35: den he went on Fox news with Shan hany
00:22:33 - 00:22:37: for an hour and acced himself very well
00:22:35 - 00:22:39: he's eloquent he's sharp yes he's got a
00:22:37 - 00:22:41: record that can be attacked but in terms
00:22:39 - 00:22:44: of the visual Optics would that not
00:22:41 - 00:22:48: concern you a bit uh as a as a trump fan
00:22:44 - 00:22:50: as a republican that you might end up
00:22:48 - 00:22:53: out of this Victory with a far more
00:22:50 - 00:22:56: difficult opponent to try and defeat in
00:22:53 - 00:22:58: November oh I I I think don't put
00:22:56 - 00:23:01: anything past the Democrats the the fact
00:22:58 - 00:23:03: that Gavin Nome can sit there and and
00:23:01 - 00:23:05: literally look at somebody in the face
00:23:03 - 00:23:08: and say Joe Biden's presidency has been
00:23:05 - 00:23:10: a master class that Gavin Newsome is one
00:23:08 - 00:23:13: of the the most disgusting Snakes in the
00:23:10 - 00:23:15: Grass just look at look at California
00:23:13 - 00:23:16: okay I even had to write this down uh
00:23:15 - 00:23:18: Pierce highest taxes in the nation
00:23:16 - 00:23:20: thousands of businesses have left
00:23:18 - 00:23:21: mandatory vaccine bills losing child
00:23:20 - 00:23:24: cuss the over if your child doesn't
00:23:21 - 00:23:26: transition $7 gas this is and I'm
00:23:24 - 00:23:27: telling you right now uh Pierce it's
00:23:26 - 00:23:30: scary as hell and I don't care what
00:23:27 - 00:23:32: anybody says this has all been a plan
00:23:30 - 00:23:34: okay they moved the debates up early all
00:23:32 - 00:23:36: right they didn't give him any whatever
00:23:34 - 00:23:39: he was on on the on the uh State of the
00:23:36 - 00:23:41: Union Piers that that 60 minutes he was
00:23:39 - 00:23:42: up they probably gave him adrin he was
00:23:41 - 00:23:43: there he was in the moment this was
00:23:42 - 00:23:45: their time where they put him up there
00:23:43 - 00:23:47: like a sacrificial Lam they said listen
00:23:45 - 00:23:48: Jill we're not going to give Joe any
00:23:47 - 00:23:50: drugs we're going to roll him out there
00:23:48 - 00:23:52: he looked lost he had no idea what he's
00:23:50 - 00:23:55: going to do I think the shift is going
00:23:52 - 00:23:57: to happen 100% there is absolutely no
00:23:55 - 00:23:59: way they're going to stay with him and
00:23:57 - 00:24:01: that is going to be a huge challenge for
00:23:59 - 00:24:03: the Republicans because all this because
00:24:01 - 00:24:04: we've had a case study uh Piers we've
00:24:03 - 00:24:06: had four years of trump and now we're
00:24:04 - 00:24:09: gonna have four years of Biden there is
00:24:06 - 00:24:11: no debate there's no arguing the country
00:24:09 - 00:24:12: is is [ __ ] right now and I know Hassan
00:24:11 - 00:24:14: said you know Trump was talking about
00:24:12 - 00:24:17: the border and illegals are the problem
00:24:14 - 00:24:19: they are the problem okay they are
00:24:17 - 00:24:21: Carrie mentioned one story there's been
00:24:19 - 00:24:24: four this week four of young girls
00:24:21 - 00:24:26: getting raped and murders and people
00:24:24 - 00:24:27: like that that say oh it's not really
00:24:26 - 00:24:29: it's not really a problem you say that
00:24:27 - 00:24:31: cuz it's not happening to you or your
00:24:29 - 00:24:33: family or your daughter or your mother
00:24:31 - 00:24:35: okay it is a problem and by the end of
00:24:33 - 00:24:36: this four years the number is probably
00:24:35 - 00:24:38: be million whole state of California I
00:24:36 - 00:24:43: don't know what you're talking about I I

00:24:43 - 00:24:49: governor

00:24:51 - 00:24:56: your oh yeah Sinking by the way first of
00:24:53 - 00:24:59: all I don't respect any nepple baby that

00:24:59 - 00:25:04: I want the audience to know this guy
00:25:01 - 00:25:06: Hassan has said in the past that America

00:25:06 - 00:25:10: even open your mouth don't even open

00:25:26 - 00:25:29: be on this [ __ ] panel I'm sorry for
00:25:27 - 00:25:31: my language he doesn't belong on your
00:25:29 - 00:25:34: show that being said Pier it'll be a
00:25:31 - 00:25:37: huge challenge huge challenge for
00:25:34 - 00:25:38: Democrats Donald not all say let's not
00:25:37 - 00:25:42: be children yeah I think that's a very
00:25:38 - 00:25:45: good cool Jenna yeah try and keep try
00:25:42 - 00:25:46: keep you know see what was interesting
00:25:45 - 00:25:48: well hang on hang on hang on what was
00:25:46 - 00:25:50: interesting about last night actually um
00:25:48 - 00:25:53: I'll bring Chen back in here I thought I
00:25:50 - 00:25:55: like the format actually of the way CNN
00:25:53 - 00:25:57: did this I thought Jake Tapper and Dana
00:25:55 - 00:25:59: Bash did a very competent job but also I
00:25:57 - 00:26:02: like the format where there was no
00:25:59 - 00:26:05: audience to manipulate perhaps or save a
00:26:02 - 00:26:07: candidate for themselves um or to
00:26:05 - 00:26:09: overreact to try and drown out a
00:26:07 - 00:26:10: particularly Salient Point uh and and
00:26:09 - 00:26:12: the mute button worked very well you can
00:26:10 - 00:26:14: see both candidates trying to speak at
00:26:12 - 00:26:16: various times when their mute button was
00:26:14 - 00:26:18: on I I don't know what you thought but I
00:26:16 - 00:26:20: actually thought it was a pretty good
00:26:18 - 00:26:22: format uh for showing us what the
00:26:20 - 00:26:26: reality was of these two
00:26:22 - 00:26:28: candidates so Piers uh a lot of people
00:26:26 - 00:26:30: are criticizing CNN now and in fact they
00:26:28 - 00:26:31: themselves this morning admitted that
00:26:30 - 00:26:34: maybe we should have fact checked Trump
00:26:31 - 00:26:37: once or twice uh when he said like
00:26:34 - 00:26:40: derange things like oh there's postbirth
00:26:37 - 00:26:42: abortions that that doesn't make any
00:26:40 - 00:26:45: sense at all but my answer would be why
00:26:42 - 00:26:46: Jo Joe Biden should have done right B
00:26:45 - 00:26:50: Biden should have called him out on all
00:26:46 - 00:26:51: those things but he wasn't able to do it
00:26:50 - 00:26:55: hold on that's exactly what I'm getting
00:26:51 - 00:26:57: to so you know when you somebody says
00:26:55 - 00:26:59: something so stupid like that and like
00:26:57 - 00:27:00: Trump says oh they let out all the
00:26:59 - 00:27:03: mental institutions and the prisoners of
00:27:00 - 00:27:05: countries the opponent has a
00:27:03 - 00:27:08: responsibility to say which countries
00:27:05 - 00:27:10: yeah tell me which countries released
00:27:08 - 00:27:12: all their prisoners and mental uh
00:27:10 - 00:27:14: inmates Etc what are you talking about
00:27:12 - 00:27:16: postbirth abortion that doesn't even
00:27:14 - 00:27:18: make any sense you derange lunatic so
00:27:16 - 00:27:21: yeah I'm not on getting on Jake Tapper
00:27:18 - 00:27:24: or danab bash the guy opposed to you is
00:27:21 - 00:27:26: supposed to make those super obvious
00:27:24 - 00:27:27: points look at this point this
00:27:26 - 00:27:29: conversation about whether Joe Biden's
00:27:27 - 00:27:31: going to drop is over he's definitely
00:27:29 - 00:27:33: going to drop out the donors no longer
00:27:31 - 00:27:36: think he's a good investment and think
00:27:33 - 00:27:38: about this Piers if he doesn't Drop Out
00:27:36 - 00:27:41: imagine what history is going to say
00:27:38 - 00:27:44: about him that he put his monstrous ego
00:27:41 - 00:27:46: maybe the maybe an ego even larger than
00:27:44 - 00:27:49: Donald Trump's above the needs of the
00:27:46 - 00:27:51: country the party the voters it's an
00:27:49 - 00:27:53: unbearable thought he would become one
00:27:51 - 00:27:55: of the great villains of American
00:27:53 - 00:27:57: history and there's actually a really
00:27:55 - 00:27:59: easy way to replace them all he has to
00:27:57 - 00:28:00: do is say I'm out and then we go back to
00:27:59 - 00:28:03: a traditional convention where the
00:28:00 - 00:28:06: delegates decide that's almost always
00:28:03 - 00:28:08: how Americans by the way anyway yeah we
00:28:06 - 00:28:10: discussed it before but two incumbent
00:28:08 - 00:28:12: Democrat Presidents since the end of
00:28:10 - 00:28:16: World War II have both stood down in
00:28:12 - 00:28:18: election year Harry Truman and uh Lyndon
00:28:16 - 00:28:20: Johnson so there is a precedent here for
00:28:18 - 00:28:22: for this to happen it just hasn't
00:28:20 - 00:28:24: happened where the incumbent president
00:28:22 - 00:28:26: doesn't want to go uh Jenner I want to
00:28:24 - 00:28:28: bring you in just on one point which is
00:28:26 - 00:28:29: the behavior of Jill Biden after to the
00:28:28 - 00:28:32: debate watch
00:28:29 - 00:28:37: this oh you did such a great job you
00:28:32 - 00:28:37: answered every question you knew all
00:28:38 - 00:28:45: the and let me ask the crowd what did
00:28:41 - 00:28:45: Trump do
00:28:46 - 00:28:51: why God I mean I found that pretty uh
00:28:49 - 00:28:53: painful to watch he then let a chter
00:28:51 - 00:28:56: four more years and the reason it's
00:28:53 - 00:28:59: painful is she she's Dr Jill Biden this
00:28:56 - 00:29:00: is her husband he's in front of you know
00:28:59 - 00:29:02: maybe a hundred million people in
00:29:00 - 00:29:05: America alone tens of millions more
00:29:02 - 00:29:09: watching around the world being utterly
00:29:05 - 00:29:12: humiliated clearly has onset dementia
00:29:09 - 00:29:15: and is being you know dragged through an
00:29:12 - 00:29:17: incredibly embarrassing humiliating
00:29:15 - 00:29:18: process of this debate being mocked and
00:29:17 - 00:29:21: laughed at around the world and rather
00:29:18 - 00:29:23: than do what any normal spouse would do
00:29:21 - 00:29:26: I think in that situation which is be
00:29:23 - 00:29:29: protective and save Joe Biden from
00:29:26 - 00:29:32: himself she seemed even Keener than he
00:29:29 - 00:29:34: is for him to carry on and to perpetrate
00:29:32 - 00:29:36: and continue to perpetrate the lie that
00:29:34 - 00:29:39: there's nothing wrong here he answered
00:29:36 - 00:29:40: every question well he he didn't even
00:29:39 - 00:29:42: understand most of the questions from
00:29:40 - 00:29:46: what I could see what did you think
00:29:42 - 00:29:49: about her as the as the first lady and
00:29:46 - 00:29:52: her responsibility
00:29:49 - 00:29:54: here well she's clearly married to power
00:29:52 - 00:29:56: not to Joe Biden personally and that's
00:29:54 - 00:29:58: incredibly tragic um I mean I was
00:29:56 - 00:30:00: watching this debate with my parents who
00:29:58 - 00:30:03: have been happily married for almost 50
00:30:00 - 00:30:05: years and my mom was almost in tears
00:30:03 - 00:30:07: looking at how frail and tragic of a
00:30:05 - 00:30:10: figure Joe Biden was on stage we all
00:30:07 - 00:30:12: said our heart went out to him I mean I
00:30:10 - 00:30:15: I could sympathize with Van Jones on the
00:30:12 - 00:30:17: panel after CNN moved to tears saying he
00:30:15 - 00:30:20: just looked terrible everybody knows
00:30:17 - 00:30:22: that he clearly is sick he is unable to
00:30:20 - 00:30:24: fulfill his duties and yet here is Jill
00:30:22 - 00:30:26: Biden the one person in his life that
00:30:24 - 00:30:29: should be telling him listen you've got
00:30:26 - 00:30:31: to step down helping facilitate that
00:30:29 - 00:30:33: looking out for his best interest not to
00:30:31 - 00:30:34: mention the country as the first lady
00:30:33 - 00:30:36: but his own best interest and she's the
00:30:34 - 00:30:38: one who's standing up treating him like
00:30:36 - 00:30:40: a child I mean it was like she was in a
00:30:38 - 00:30:42: preschool class and telling him as a
00:30:40 - 00:30:46: toddler you did a good job little one
00:30:42 - 00:30:48: you I mean it was so unbearably pathetic
00:30:46 - 00:30:49: this woman would prioritize this I've
00:30:48 - 00:30:52: got four kids it's like when your
00:30:49 - 00:30:54: four-year-old comes last in in a race on
00:30:52 - 00:30:55: sports day and you tell them you did a
00:30:54 - 00:30:58: great you did a great job that's really
00:30:55 - 00:31:00: what it felt like to me it's an absolute
00:30:58 - 00:31:03: lie everyone saw your king come last you
00:31:00 - 00:31:05: don't want him to be too upset and I was
00:31:03 - 00:31:08: I've been really struck by F the
00:31:05 - 00:31:10: immediate because I used to work at CNN
00:31:08 - 00:31:13: for four years I was there on Election
00:31:10 - 00:31:16: nights in 2012 and stuff I have never
00:31:13 - 00:31:18: seen a CNN panel react the way they did
00:31:16 - 00:31:21: at the immediate end of that debate John
00:31:18 - 00:31:24: King absolutely
00:31:21 - 00:31:26: lacerated uh Biden's performance in a
00:31:24 - 00:31:28: way I've never seen him do van Jones
00:31:26 - 00:31:32: like you say was sort of tear
00:31:28 - 00:31:34: David axod pounded him but they all did
00:31:32 - 00:31:36: and I was really struck by well we we
00:31:34 - 00:31:39: got a clip of some of this let's take a
00:31:36 - 00:31:41: look as we speak there is a deep a wide
00:31:39 - 00:31:43: and a very aggressive panic in the
00:31:41 - 00:31:46: Democratic party it started minutes into
00:31:43 - 00:31:48: the debate and it continues right now it
00:31:46 - 00:31:50: involves party strategists it involves
00:31:48 - 00:31:51: elected officials it involves
00:31:50 - 00:31:53: fundraisers and they are having
00:31:51 - 00:31:55: conversations about the president's
00:31:53 - 00:31:56: performance which they think was dismal
00:31:55 - 00:31:58: which they think will hurt other people
00:31:56 - 00:31:59: down the party in the
00:31:58 - 00:32:01: and they're having conversations about
00:31:59 - 00:32:02: what they should do about it some of
00:32:01 - 00:32:04: those conversations include should we go
00:32:02 - 00:32:06: to the White House and ask the president
00:32:04 - 00:32:08: to step aside others are other the
00:32:06 - 00:32:11: conversations are about should prominent
00:32:08 - 00:32:13: Democrats go public with that call
00:32:11 - 00:32:15: because they feel this debate was so
00:32:13 - 00:32:17: terrible uh they do say in in moments in
00:32:15 - 00:32:18: the debate later the president got
00:32:17 - 00:32:20: better and got his footing but then at
00:32:18 - 00:32:22: the end even his closing statement was a
00:32:20 - 00:32:24: little halting the contrast between the
00:32:22 - 00:32:26: two candidates it wasn't a little
00:32:24 - 00:32:28: halting the end the end of that debate
00:32:26 - 00:32:30: that the summary budget Joe Biden was
00:32:28 - 00:32:32: incomprehensible gibberish well joining
00:32:30 - 00:32:35: me now is Joe Biden's former White House
00:32:32 - 00:32:36: advisor Mo Vel you know mo I brought a
00:32:35 - 00:32:39: Callum to New York Post which is just
00:32:36 - 00:32:41: going up now where I said I genuinely
00:32:39 - 00:32:42: felt very sad I i' I've never
00:32:41 - 00:32:44: interviewed Joe Biden but I had a a
00:32:42 - 00:32:47: phone call once with him after his son
00:32:44 - 00:32:49: Bo died it was a very moving and
00:32:47 - 00:32:50: emotional conversation we had he was
00:32:49 - 00:32:53: vice president at the time it was 10
00:32:50 - 00:32:56: years ago and I remember every word of
00:32:53 - 00:32:59: that and he was he was uh somebody I I
00:32:56 - 00:33:01: just was very impressed by actually in
00:32:59 - 00:33:03: the way he handled that call and the
00:33:01 - 00:33:05: reasons that we we had it when I watched
00:33:03 - 00:33:08: Joe Biden last night I I didn't
00:33:05 - 00:33:11: recognize that person he is not the
00:33:08 - 00:33:14: person he used to be and I felt a real
00:33:11 - 00:33:17: sense of sadness as I would for any uh
00:33:14 - 00:33:21: old person clearly suffering now from
00:33:17 - 00:33:25: some form of scile dementia Exposed on
00:33:21 - 00:33:27: such a gigantic live television stage to
00:33:25 - 00:33:28: utter humiliation I don't think it's
00:33:27 - 00:33:32: something you feel jubilant about you
00:33:28 - 00:33:34: just feel sadness for him uh and real
00:33:32 - 00:33:38: discomfort I got to say from here in
00:33:34 - 00:33:40: London watching America's president
00:33:38 - 00:33:43: basically self- imploding like that on a
00:33:40 - 00:33:44: on a world stage was pretty scary I mean
00:33:43 - 00:33:47: this is the guy with his finger on the
00:33:44 - 00:33:49: nuclear button for America you as his
00:33:47 - 00:33:53: former adviser what were you
00:33:49 - 00:33:56: thinking well I you know I share your
00:33:53 - 00:33:58: sentiment of sadness Pierce to be honest
00:33:56 - 00:34:02: with you I was sad for a variety of
00:33:58 - 00:34:05: reasons one Joe Biden is somebody I love
00:34:02 - 00:34:07: very dearly I know him quite well he and
00:34:05 - 00:34:10: Dr Biden are beautiful beautiful human
00:34:07 - 00:34:13: beings he has literally dedicated his
00:34:10 - 00:34:16: entire adult life to this nation
00:34:13 - 00:34:19: arguably he saved our democracy already
00:34:16 - 00:34:21: once um but he has dedicated his life to
00:34:19 - 00:34:24: public service in our country and you
00:34:21 - 00:34:27: can't help but love this decent
00:34:24 - 00:34:30: beautiful warm human being so it was sad
00:34:27 - 00:34:32: for the reasons you stated I was also
00:34:30 - 00:34:37: mad Pierce because I thought this was a
00:34:32 - 00:34:40: political blunder an absolute strategic
00:34:37 - 00:34:42: mistake from his campaign uh to put him
00:34:40 - 00:34:44: out there like that whether he was
00:34:42 - 00:34:47: feeling well or not or whatever the
00:34:44 - 00:34:50: reasons were as you allude to possibly
00:34:47 - 00:34:52: early on set whatever um it doesn't
00:34:50 - 00:34:55: matter you don't put your candidate out
00:34:52 - 00:34:58: there if you're not absolutely confident
00:34:55 - 00:35:00: that they are ready to perform um so I
00:34:58 - 00:35:03: was angry um but you know what I know
00:35:00 - 00:35:07: him Pierce and I'll tell you what I know
00:35:03 - 00:35:09: about him he's decent as I said before
00:35:07 - 00:35:10: and I think he's going to meditate and I
00:35:09 - 00:35:12: think he's going to reflect and I think
00:35:10 - 00:35:15: he's going to surround himself with his
00:35:12 - 00:35:18: family who he loves uh by the way to uh
00:35:15 - 00:35:20: Jenna I I appreciated so many of things
00:35:18 - 00:35:22: you said a while ago uh Jenna and I want
00:35:20 - 00:35:25: to say this to you though it was sure
00:35:22 - 00:35:27: nice to see a wife love their husband
00:35:25 - 00:35:30: enough to be at the debate and to come
00:35:27 - 00:35:33: out and actually kiss her husband and to
00:35:30 - 00:35:37: love him and most wives I hope all of
00:35:33 - 00:35:39: your spouses I'm a single gay man but um
00:35:37 - 00:35:41: but if I had a spouse they sure the hell
00:35:39 - 00:35:44: better defend me in my worst moments in
00:35:41 - 00:35:45: life because that's what I think love is
00:35:44 - 00:35:48: about
00:35:45 - 00:35:50: so here's the help him off the stage
00:35:48 - 00:35:52: though she had to
00:35:50 - 00:35:54: help him and I'm going to show that I'm
00:35:52 - 00:35:55: going to show that very clip actually
00:35:54 - 00:35:58: let's watch that
00:35:55 - 00:36:00: clip now in the book in front of the
00:35:58 - 00:36:02: voters tonight along with Aon Bernette
00:36:00 - 00:36:03: first word on what those voters might
00:36:02 - 00:36:06: make now you see what you're seeing
00:36:03 - 00:36:09: there is is Dr Biden guiding Joe Biden
00:36:06 - 00:36:10: the president down literally two steps
00:36:09 - 00:36:13: because she's worried he's going to fall
00:36:10 - 00:36:16: over and only two weeks ago we saw
00:36:13 - 00:36:18: Barack Obama take uh his former vice
00:36:16 - 00:36:20: president's hand and guide him off the
00:36:18 - 00:36:22: stage at a fundraiser in LA and I
00:36:20 - 00:36:25: actually tweeted at that time with that
00:36:22 - 00:36:28: clip I posted on on X that I thought
00:36:25 - 00:36:31: this was just so uh
00:36:28 - 00:36:32: awful uh to watch why are the Democrats
00:36:31 - 00:36:35: going to carry on allowing this to
00:36:32 - 00:36:37: happen and stand by Biden as a candidate
00:36:35 - 00:36:39: and an interesting series of things
00:36:37 - 00:36:42: happen uh Bill Amman the the billionaire
00:36:39 - 00:36:44: hedge fund guy uh sent me a long
00:36:42 - 00:36:46: response in which he talked about it was
00:36:44 - 00:36:48: obvious to him that Biden's mental and
00:36:46 - 00:36:51: physical accurity now were just simply
00:36:48 - 00:36:53: not uh up to the job of of being
00:36:51 - 00:36:56: president of the United States uh and he
00:36:53 - 00:36:59: carried on explaining you know why age
00:36:56 - 00:37:01: is is relev here and how he just doesn't
00:36:59 - 00:37:04: think he can do the job anymore and we
00:37:01 - 00:37:07: were talking all like this and then um
00:37:04 - 00:37:10: we had an enormous Kickback from all
00:37:07 - 00:37:13: sorts of people led by Mark Cuban um who
00:37:10 - 00:37:15: another billionaire business guy who
00:37:13 - 00:37:17: pounded into me and Bill Atman and said
00:37:15 - 00:37:19: that we were playing to the gallery
00:37:17 - 00:37:21: playing to our followers that we were
00:37:19 - 00:37:24: denying the reality which is both Trump
00:37:21 - 00:37:26: and Biden were equally frail and infirm
00:37:24 - 00:37:27: and so on and I did I did message him
00:37:26 - 00:37:31: today and I said Mark do you do you want
00:37:27 - 00:37:32: to re-evaluate what you tweeted us and
00:37:31 - 00:37:34: the attack you made on us because it
00:37:32 - 00:37:37: turns out if anything we
00:37:34 - 00:37:39: understated how bad the situation is and
00:37:37 - 00:37:42: I think Mo the the reality for the
00:37:39 - 00:37:45: Democrats surely is if they go ahead
00:37:42 - 00:37:47: with Joe Biden now as their nominee then
00:37:45 - 00:37:50: Donald Trump is going to win I would say
00:37:47 - 00:37:52: extremely easily in November whereas if
00:37:50 - 00:37:54: they get rid of him they have got a
00:37:52 - 00:37:57: chance of getting somebody younger more
00:37:54 - 00:37:59: Dynamic who just might re-energize the
00:37:57 - 00:38:02: whole Democrat election
00:37:59 - 00:38:04: campaign you know Pierce here's where I
00:38:02 - 00:38:06: I've come down on it I slept on it last
00:38:04 - 00:38:09: night and here's where I woke up feeling
00:38:06 - 00:38:11: about it I know this gentleman I love
00:38:09 - 00:38:14: him I respect him I appreciate what he's
00:38:11 - 00:38:17: done for our country he has earned the
00:38:14 - 00:38:20: respect and the right to go now and make
00:38:17 - 00:38:22: his decision I really believe that he
00:38:20 - 00:38:25: will reflect on this and he will do what
00:38:22 - 00:38:28: is right for our country he's dedicated
00:38:25 - 00:38:30: his own life to this nation I cannot
00:38:28 - 00:38:33: imagine that right now he's going to at
00:38:30 - 00:38:35: the very beautiful uh this inflection
00:38:33 - 00:38:38: point not do what's right for our
00:38:35 - 00:38:41: democracy and for our country so I'm
00:38:38 - 00:38:43: scared because this is very clearly what
00:38:41 - 00:38:47: I left last night when I went to bed all
00:38:43 - 00:38:51: I could think was old man versus con man
00:38:47 - 00:38:53: old man versus con man you've got the
00:38:51 - 00:38:57: convicted felon who just lied for an
00:38:53 - 00:38:59: hour and a half unchecked by the way Mo
00:38:57 - 00:39:02: but Mo here's the
00:38:59 - 00:39:04: problem here's the problem here's the
00:39:02 - 00:39:05: problem Joe Biden was also fact checked
00:39:04 - 00:39:07: last night and a lot of the stuff that
00:39:05 - 00:39:09: came out of his mouth was total nonsense
00:39:07 - 00:39:11: too including by the way we saw Joe
00:39:09 - 00:39:14: Biden literally try to convince the
00:39:11 - 00:39:18: world that his golf handicap is six I am
00:39:14 - 00:39:21: a 16 handicapper at golf I will hereby
00:39:18 - 00:39:24: bet I put this on X earlier I'll bet a
00:39:21 - 00:39:26: $100,000 to a charity of Joe Biden's
00:39:24 - 00:39:30: choice not not only will I beat him off
00:39:26 - 00:39:32: my 16 handicap so 10 worse than him
00:39:30 - 00:39:34: apparently then Not only would I beat
00:39:32 - 00:39:36: him I don't want any shots off him in
00:39:34 - 00:39:39: fact I'll give him a shot a hole and I
00:39:36 - 00:39:41: will still beat him there is no way Joe
00:39:39 - 00:39:43: Biden can even play golf these days
00:39:41 - 00:39:45: right so that was another Whopper he
00:39:43 - 00:39:47: told so when it comes to Whoppers most
00:39:45 - 00:39:48: of what came out of Joe Biden's mouth
00:39:47 - 00:39:51: was a load of old
00:39:48 - 00:39:54: baloney listen I don't think he's a
00:39:51 - 00:39:56: would call it Malarkey as as he would
00:39:54 - 00:39:57: call it Malarkey but pierce with you
00:39:56 - 00:39:59: know I have a lot of respect for you I
00:39:57 - 00:40:01: was with you four years ago or three and
00:39:59 - 00:40:04: a half years ago on Election night yeah
00:40:01 - 00:40:08: um I I you know I respect you your
00:40:04 - 00:40:10: incredible Talent uh but but listen if
00:40:08 - 00:40:13: anybody out there is worried about
00:40:10 - 00:40:15: Gulf right when we have the Ukraine or
00:40:13 - 00:40:18: not the Ukraine but Ukraine we have the
00:40:15 - 00:40:19: Gaza Israeli situation we have we're
00:40:18 - 00:40:21: paying too much for eggs and a little
00:40:19 - 00:40:23: bit more than we should for gas and so
00:40:21 - 00:40:24: on and so forth these are the issues
00:40:23 - 00:40:26: that people are worried about but
00:40:24 - 00:40:28: actually I think remot here's the thing
00:40:26 - 00:40:29: and I appre appreciate your comments and
00:40:28 - 00:40:31: I feel the same about you I think you
00:40:29 - 00:40:33: you've been great when you you come on
00:40:31 - 00:40:35: but here's the point it's not about golf
00:40:33 - 00:40:37: it's about Joe Biden lying about his
00:40:35 - 00:40:38: golf handicap about how good he is and
00:40:37 - 00:40:40: it's also about the fact that actually
00:40:38 - 00:40:43: you can't imagine him play golf Bryson
00:40:40 - 00:40:46: Des shamba the US Open champion of last
00:40:43 - 00:40:49: week uh has tweeted He he'll put on the
00:40:46 - 00:40:51: match Biden Trump God can you imagine
00:40:49 - 00:40:54: them trying to play golf against each
00:40:51 - 00:40:56: other so the point is is Joe Biden fit
00:40:54 - 00:40:58: mentally and physically to do the job I
00:40:56 - 00:41:00: don't think any one with half a brain
00:40:58 - 00:41:03: can conclude after last night that he is
00:41:00 - 00:41:05: it's very sad it's very sad but actually
00:41:03 - 00:41:06: very selfish if he continues to pretend
00:41:05 - 00:41:09: he
00:41:06 - 00:41:12: can okay so to very quickly I don't want
00:41:09 - 00:41:14: to hog up any of your time but one thing
00:41:12 - 00:41:17: first please I love you so much please
00:41:14 - 00:41:20: be an equal opportunity criticizer
00:41:17 - 00:41:22: because I am and I love I've been listen
00:41:20 - 00:41:23: I've been very critical of trump over
00:41:22 - 00:41:26: the years especially in the last two or
00:41:23 - 00:41:27: three years I I think last night Trump
00:41:26 - 00:41:29: definitely said loads of things that
00:41:27 - 00:41:31: weren't true as he does he embellished
00:41:29 - 00:41:33: he exaggerated all those things but
00:41:31 - 00:41:35: here's the thing Mo no one today is
00:41:33 - 00:41:36: talking about Donald Trump what they
00:41:35 - 00:41:38: should have been talking what they
00:41:36 - 00:41:41: should have been talking about is Joe
00:41:38 - 00:41:44: Biden the president holding Trump to
00:41:41 - 00:41:46: account on a massive stage for all the
00:41:44 - 00:41:49: lies he was telling but he couldn't do
00:41:46 - 00:41:53: it so instead everyone is talking about
00:41:49 - 00:41:56: Biden's inability to hold him to account
00:41:53 - 00:41:59: and that is why I'm sad and mad Pierce
00:41:56 - 00:42:01: because I'm upset because the president
00:41:59 - 00:42:04: deserved the opportunity to do that he
00:42:01 - 00:42:08: clearly was not on his game last night
00:42:04 - 00:42:11: he he clearly it was abysmal yeah at
00:42:08 - 00:42:13: best okay and so we I'm not gonna come
00:42:11 - 00:42:15: on your show and try to spin out of that
00:42:13 - 00:42:16: because it's in it's not possible no
00:42:15 - 00:42:18: well
00:42:16 - 00:42:19: listen it's been good to have you on the
00:42:18 - 00:42:20: show I appreciate you joining me again
00:42:19 - 00:42:23: thank you very much let's go back to the
00:42:20 - 00:42:26: panel uh Chen let me let me ask you
00:42:23 - 00:42:27: about this I mean look I can see people
00:42:26 - 00:42:29: trying you know people a lot of people
00:42:27 - 00:42:30: in the Democrat Party Like Biden they
00:42:29 - 00:42:32: you know I've read Thomas Freeman saying
00:42:30 - 00:42:34: he cried last night the New York Times
00:42:32 - 00:42:36: Colonist when he was watching it you
00:42:34 - 00:42:38: know Frank bruny was sort of tearing up
00:42:36 - 00:42:41: everyone's tearing up I don't really
00:42:38 - 00:42:43: feel emotional I'm afraid and I find it
00:42:41 - 00:42:45: very hard to feel sympathy for Joe Biden
00:42:43 - 00:42:47: I think it was very sad what we watched
00:42:45 - 00:42:49: but I also think as we're now at the
00:42:47 - 00:42:53: stage where this is actually willfully
00:42:49 - 00:42:54: selfish and Haring to the Democrat Party
00:42:53 - 00:42:57: isn't
00:42:54 - 00:42:59: it yeah so I I only have one
00:42:57 - 00:43:01: uh point that I have sympathy for Joe
00:42:59 - 00:43:03: Biden but first of all these guys I mean
00:43:01 - 00:43:05: look at the people in power whether it's
00:43:03 - 00:43:07: Media or Democratic Leadership they're
00:43:05 - 00:43:10: all crying because oh their beloved Joe
00:43:07 - 00:43:14: Biden uh didn't look good I mean this
00:43:10 - 00:43:17: guy just sent 20 billion do to slaughter
00:43:14 - 00:43:19: more Palestinian children I I cry for
00:43:17 - 00:43:21: them I don't cry for Joe Biden this Joe
00:43:19 - 00:43:22: Biden is taking corporate donations his
00:43:21 - 00:43:26: entire life he used to be known as the
00:43:22 - 00:43:28: senator from MBNA this guy is a classic
00:43:26 - 00:43:30: corporate corrupt Democrat so I I don't
00:43:28 - 00:43:33: join any of this like oh my God he was
00:43:30 - 00:43:35: such a good person and think about this
00:43:33 - 00:43:37: this guy and and even if you disagree
00:43:35 - 00:43:39: with me and you think oh my God no I
00:43:37 - 00:43:41: love establishment Democrats that sell
00:43:39 - 00:43:42: us out to the donors oh you're so
00:43:41 - 00:43:44: radical for saying things that are
00:43:42 - 00:43:47: obviously true but think about this even
00:43:44 - 00:43:50: for those guys he was willing to risk
00:43:47 - 00:43:52: all of us the Democratic voters the
00:43:50 - 00:43:55: Democratic party the entire country just
00:43:52 - 00:43:57: to satiate a ego oh I want to be a
00:43:55 - 00:43:59: two-term president that's better for my
00:43:57 - 00:44:01: Legacy so he's an egomaniac that I have
00:43:59 - 00:44:05: no sympathy for except one
00:44:01 - 00:44:07: thing last night was elder abuse and it
00:44:05 - 00:44:10: was elder abuse by the entire Democratic
00:44:07 - 00:44:12: Leadership the DNC and yes sorry but
00:44:10 - 00:44:15: Jill Biden if Jill Biden wants to run
00:44:12 - 00:44:17: for president she should do it but I
00:44:15 - 00:44:20: mean there's no way that a loving spouse
00:44:17 - 00:44:21: lets that happen and thinks oh great
00:44:20 - 00:44:23: push him out there push him out there we
00:44:21 - 00:44:25: got this you don't have it this is
00:44:23 - 00:44:28: absurd but the one piece of good news
00:44:25 - 00:44:29: out of all this peers is it's over we're
00:44:28 - 00:44:30: going to get a new candidate and
00:44:29 - 00:44:33: hopefully we're going to kick Donald
00:44:30 - 00:44:35: Trump's ass before we go do that before
00:44:33 - 00:44:37: we go to Hassan who would just quickly
00:44:35 - 00:44:39: who would your preference be for who
00:44:37 - 00:44:40: that person should be that could
00:44:39 - 00:44:41: actually be the nominee and potentially
00:44:40 - 00:44:44: beat
00:44:41 - 00:44:46: Trump so the problem with the Democratic
00:44:44 - 00:44:48: party is that they never pick a populist
00:44:46 - 00:44:50: in a populist time they keep picking the
00:44:48 - 00:44:51: most establishment candidates there are
00:44:50 - 00:44:53: when the American people keep telling
00:44:51 - 00:44:56: you they don't want establishment
00:44:53 - 00:44:57: candidates like Hillary Clinton and Joe
00:44:56 - 00:44:59: Biden so they should should pick a
00:44:57 - 00:45:01: populist but they won't of course the
00:44:59 - 00:45:04: top candidate is Bernie Sanders and he
00:45:01 - 00:45:05: would easily easily beat Donald Trump
00:45:04 - 00:45:08: everybody actually knows that they just
00:45:05 - 00:45:09: don't and let's be honest the Democratic
00:45:08 - 00:45:11: party would rather have Donald Trump
00:45:09 - 00:45:13: than Bernie Sanders so but if you say no
00:45:11 - 00:45:16: Bernie Sanders is too old or we we can't
00:45:13 - 00:45:18: have it you can go to rokana you can go
00:45:16 - 00:45:21: to Jamie Rasin Jamie Raskin is beloved
00:45:18 - 00:45:24: by everyone in the Democratic party he's
00:45:21 - 00:45:26: incredibly smart incredibly principled
00:45:24 - 00:45:28: pick I mean he would eviscerate Donald
00:45:26 - 00:45:30: Trump and debate let's pick someone who
00:45:28 - 00:45:33: can win and actually represent the
00:45:30 - 00:45:35: people okay um before I come to Hassan
00:45:33 - 00:45:36: let me just get Vinnie's reaction that
00:45:35 - 00:45:38: what one name I'm afraid I'm gonna
00:45:36 - 00:45:42: disagree with Jank there yeah go on then
00:45:38 - 00:45:46: okay Hassan you respond yeah okay first
00:45:42 - 00:45:49: of all big Gretch that's it that's the
00:45:46 - 00:45:53: method that's the movement okay put Mama
00:45:49 - 00:45:56: Gretch in office okay she's popular
00:45:53 - 00:45:58: she's in a pivotal State she would
00:45:56 - 00:46:00: absolutely rush it you got I don't like
00:45:58 - 00:46:02: Gavin Newsome at all I think he has a
00:46:00 - 00:46:05: lot of weaknesses I think he's horrible
00:46:02 - 00:46:07: he's done a abysmal job uh refusing to
00:46:05 - 00:46:09: fix the housing crisis in California
00:46:07 - 00:46:11: that's obviously contributing to the
00:46:09 - 00:46:14: homelessness crisis so that you know uh
00:46:11 - 00:46:16: guys like Vinnie can complain about how
00:46:14 - 00:46:18: much of a [ __ ] hole California is or
00:46:16 - 00:46:21: whatever people talk about like that
00:46:18 - 00:46:22: would stick on a national level on Gavin
00:46:21 - 00:46:24: Newsome don't turn Cal don't turn the
00:46:22 - 00:46:27: rest of the country into California
00:46:24 - 00:46:29: would be the attitude uh another good
00:46:27 - 00:46:32: guy I think uh another great guy JB
00:46:29 - 00:46:34: pritsker governor of Illinois we need a
00:46:32 - 00:46:36: big boy in office we need we need a
00:46:34 - 00:46:38: Dynamo we need a guy with a kind heart
00:46:36 - 00:46:40: you know he could even I'm not I'm not
00:46:38 - 00:46:42: exactly a fan of uh him being a
00:46:40 - 00:46:43: billionaire But ultimately you know
00:46:42 - 00:46:45: maybe maybe we could have a real
00:46:43 - 00:46:47: billionaire against the Donald Trump's
00:46:45 - 00:46:50: phony billionaire status who knows
00:46:47 - 00:46:53: anyone will be better than uh than than
00:46:50 - 00:46:56: Joe Biden at this point even Hillary
00:46:53 - 00:46:57: Clinton at this point that's interesting
00:46:56 - 00:47:00: so
00:46:57 - 00:47:02: well hang H for those who don't know who
00:47:00 - 00:47:05: the Gretch is by the way it's the
00:47:02 - 00:47:07: Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer but I
00:47:05 - 00:47:09: want to come to I want to come to Vinnie
00:47:07 - 00:47:12: Hillary Clinton's name is being talked
00:47:09 - 00:47:14: up here as potentially the unfinished
00:47:12 - 00:47:16: business that she comes sweeping back
00:47:14 - 00:47:19: and she does what she what she failed to
00:47:16 - 00:47:22: do in 2016 and she actually beats him
00:47:19 - 00:47:25: what are your thoughts about Hillary
00:47:22 - 00:47:27: returning I you know what Piers I think
00:47:25 - 00:47:29: she's ABS she's she's finished Hillary
00:47:27 - 00:47:31: Clinton has no chance I think I think
00:47:29 - 00:47:34: every single time she gets in front of a
00:47:31 - 00:47:36: a camera it's hurting the the Democratic
00:47:34 - 00:47:38: uh party I think she's the worst from
00:47:36 - 00:47:39: her history with her and her husband
00:47:38 - 00:47:41: it's just it's it's abysmal let's not
00:47:39 - 00:47:43: even get into the clan foundation and
00:47:41 - 00:47:45: Epstein and her husband that's a whole
00:47:43 - 00:47:47: different Ken of worms but I think it's
00:47:45 - 00:47:50: funny how everybody on the left is so
00:47:47 - 00:47:52: you know this whole failed presidency is
00:47:50 - 00:47:54: because of Biden's age and his dementia
00:47:52 - 00:47:57: which he definitely has whoever's gonna
00:47:54 - 00:48:00: come in it's the Democratic parties
00:47:57 - 00:48:03: policies plain and simple I don't give a
00:48:00 - 00:48:04: damn who you put in there Gretch Bernie
00:48:03 - 00:48:07: saying there's communism you want
00:48:04 - 00:48:09: socialism you all that crap it's not
00:48:07 - 00:48:11: going to fix anything that shit's going
00:48:09 - 00:48:13: to keep going say what you want I last
00:48:11 - 00:48:15: night solidified even more for The
00:48:13 - 00:48:18: Independents in the middle that are kind
00:48:15 - 00:48:20: of on the fence I would much rather vote
00:48:18 - 00:48:23: for the convicted felon than this poor
00:48:20 - 00:48:25: old [ __ ] that they wheel out there now
00:48:23 - 00:48:27: on purpose like a sacrificial lamb with
00:48:25 - 00:48:30: no drugs and everything to turn you
00:48:27 - 00:48:32: notice Pi every other debate every CNN
00:48:30 - 00:48:34: anchor everybody that was moderating
00:48:32 - 00:48:36: would cut Trump off they would yell they
00:48:34 - 00:48:38: would stop notice how they sat there
00:48:36 - 00:48:40: Jake Tapper and Dana Bash they were
00:48:38 - 00:48:42: quiet they let everything pull out this
00:48:40 - 00:48:44: was all on purpose and I think that
00:48:42 - 00:48:47: Hillary Clinton's on the table I think
00:48:44 - 00:48:49: Gavin uh knew some for sure he was the
00:48:47 - 00:48:51: only one there you notice that uh he had
00:48:49 - 00:48:53: good gel in his hair he was listen I've
00:48:51 - 00:48:55: said I've said for two years that I
00:48:53 - 00:48:57: think Nome is the one that could put up
00:48:55 - 00:49:00: the best fight and I was persuaded when
00:48:57 - 00:49:03: he went on Fox News Into the Heart of of
00:49:00 - 00:49:05: the enemy Lair and sat there with Sean
00:49:03 - 00:49:06: hany for an hour and critted himself
00:49:05 - 00:49:09: very very well I mean Jenna to bring you
00:49:06 - 00:49:12: in here I mean who who Jenna if you were
00:49:09 - 00:49:16: if you were a Democrat right now who
00:49:12 - 00:49:18: would you think had the best chance of
00:49:16 - 00:49:20: actually taking Trump on you know Trump
00:49:18 - 00:49:22: very well you know his weaknesses his
00:49:20 - 00:49:25: strengths who of all the Democrat names
00:49:22 - 00:49:27: you've seen touted would you fear most
00:49:25 - 00:49:29: potentially as being the one that could
00:49:27 - 00:49:31: win it for the
00:49:29 - 00:49:33: Democrats well I actually agree with
00:49:31 - 00:49:36: what sink said that we really need a
00:49:33 - 00:49:38: populist uh on both sides that actually
00:49:36 - 00:49:41: speaks to what the American people are
00:49:38 - 00:49:45: concerned about and the if the Democrats
00:49:41 - 00:49:48: can put up someone who isn't so far
00:49:45 - 00:49:50: extreme leftist establishment uh then I
00:49:48 - 00:49:52: think that they have a real chance of
00:49:50 - 00:49:55: actually getting disect Republicans as
00:49:52 - 00:49:57: well and I think that they should put up
00:49:55 - 00:50:00: someone like an Andrew yang they should
00:49:57 - 00:50:02: have gone with RFK Jr I mean he he
00:50:00 - 00:50:04: acquitted himself very well in the
00:50:02 - 00:50:06: debate and neither side notice wanted
00:50:04 - 00:50:09: him on stage I think he is going to rise
00:50:06 - 00:50:11: in momentum after last night's debate
00:50:09 - 00:50:13: and anyone realistically that the
00:50:11 - 00:50:15: Democrats put up now if it's not someone
00:50:13 - 00:50:19: as farle as a Gretchen Whitmer for
00:50:15 - 00:50:20: example has a real shot at winning but
00:50:19 - 00:50:23: what I think the American people need to
00:50:20 - 00:50:25: do is take a hard look at
00:50:23 - 00:50:27: the a
00:50:25 - 00:50:31: minimum because look at what she did
00:50:27 - 00:50:33: during the co lockdowns look how she
00:50:31 - 00:50:35: has so look at what she did during the
00:50:33 - 00:50:37: co lockdowns look at her position on
00:50:35 - 00:50:40: Extreme on abortion look at how she has
00:50:37 - 00:50:43: run her State as a as basically taking
00:50:40 - 00:50:45: legislative power into the executive so
00:50:43 - 00:50:46: she she is she look and look at her
00:50:45 - 00:50:49: position on her position on abortion
00:50:46 - 00:50:51: that you find so extreme abortion um so
00:50:49 - 00:50:53: her position on abortion that is so
00:50:51 - 00:50:55: extreme is that she wants uh no limits
00:50:53 - 00:50:57: at all no restrictions and most of the
00:50:55 - 00:50:59: country is not for that um even the
00:50:57 - 00:51:01: Democrats themselves know that there
00:50:59 - 00:51:03: needs to be some restrictions at least
00:51:01 - 00:51:05: in third term no that is absolutely true
00:51:03 - 00:51:06: and I mean feel free to fact check me on
00:51:05 - 00:51:09: that if she's changed her position but
00:51:06 - 00:51:12: no restrictions on thir trimester is a
00:51:09 - 00:51:13: falsehood that's not a real thing every
00:51:12 - 00:51:15: conversation that we have with
00:51:13 - 00:51:17: Republicans unfortunately revolves
00:51:15 - 00:51:19: around H H
00:51:17 - 00:51:23: hallucinations my former home
00:51:19 - 00:51:25: state allows abortion until the day of
00:51:23 - 00:51:28: birth that is the law in seven states
00:51:25 - 00:51:29: right now including California where
00:51:28 - 00:51:33: Gavin is the
00:51:29 - 00:51:35: governor there is no state in the
00:51:33 - 00:51:38: country where you can have a third
00:51:35 - 00:51:43: trimester abortion without a without a
00:51:38 - 00:51:47: doctor giving you a medical exemption no
00:51:43 - 00:51:50: you still have to get psychiatric
00:51:47 - 00:51:52: evaluation a healthare evaluation it's
00:51:50 - 00:51:54: still allow women are going around that
00:51:52 - 00:51:55: is still okay you're a woman you're a
00:51:54 - 00:51:57: woman you're a woman have you ever been

00:52:10 - 00:52:15: pregnant but but it seems like I
00:52:12 - 00:52:16: understand it as as as good as you do
00:52:15 - 00:52:20: what's happening here no you actually
00:52:16 - 00:52:26: don't woman caring a pregnancy for 9
00:52:20 - 00:52:26: months I whether Hassan is pregnant
00:52:28 - 00:52:33: you're talking over each other let me I
00:52:31 - 00:52:35: just have some breaking news I have some
00:52:33 - 00:52:39: breaking news for for everyone the Biden
00:52:35 - 00:52:41: campaign spokesperson Seth Schuster says
00:52:39 - 00:52:43: that Biden will not be exiting the race
00:52:41 - 00:52:45: there's no basis for that uh there's
00:52:43 - 00:52:47: nothing that voters have indicated that
00:52:45 - 00:52:50: they agree with that senior White House
00:52:47 - 00:52:52: correspondent at CNN Kayla T said on X
00:52:50 - 00:52:55: not only does POTUS not plan to drop out
00:52:52 - 00:52:57: Biden remains committed incredibly to a
00:52:55 - 00:52:59: second debate in September an advisor
00:52:57 - 00:53:01: tells me I cannot see that happening but
00:52:59 - 00:53:05: we actually have now somebody joining us
00:53:01 - 00:53:07: who is pro Biden and thinks that he won
00:53:05 - 00:53:10: last night it's the tick tocker Harry
00:53:07 - 00:53:12: Sison uh Harry um you think Biden won
00:53:10 - 00:53:14: last night one
00:53:12 - 00:53:16: person yeah I know I did definitely uh
00:53:14 - 00:53:18: on the substance of the conversation
00:53:16 - 00:53:21: Biden won his policy was pragmatic it
00:53:18 - 00:53:23: was logical and Donald Trump uh just
00:53:21 - 00:53:25: lied the entire time is incapable of
00:53:23 - 00:53:27: telling the truth is incapable of
00:53:25 - 00:53:28: actually laying out policy he didn't
00:53:27 - 00:53:30: talk about how he's going to make the
00:53:28 - 00:53:32: American people's lives better he just
00:53:30 - 00:53:33: you know said that you know January 6th
00:53:32 - 00:53:35: didn't happen he talked about the
00:53:33 - 00:53:36: election he said that overturning row is
00:53:35 - 00:53:38: a great thing and forcing 10-year-old
00:53:36 - 00:53:40: girls to give birth is a fantastic thing
00:53:38 - 00:53:42: that was Donald Trump's debate uh so on
00:53:40 - 00:53:44: the substance of the conversation Joe
00:53:42 - 00:53:46: Biden absolutely prevailed right but the
00:53:44 - 00:53:48: problem you've got is I saw the CNN fact
00:53:46 - 00:53:50: Checkers on Joe Biden's public
00:53:48 - 00:53:53: statements last night and it was just
00:53:50 - 00:53:56: untruth after untruth after
00:53:53 - 00:53:57: untruth oh I'm not sitting here that Joe
00:53:56 - 00:53:59: I'm not sitting here telling you that
00:53:57 - 00:54:00: Joe Biden tells the truth every single
00:53:59 - 00:54:02: time he speaks or that he gets every
00:54:00 - 00:54:03: single number right and every single
00:54:02 - 00:54:05: statistic right he gets most of them
00:54:03 - 00:54:08: wrong compare that's not true to compare
00:54:05 - 00:54:10: Joe Biden's lies to Donald Trump's lies
00:54:08 - 00:54:12: is laughable Trump told over 30,000 lies
00:54:10 - 00:54:14: during his presidency averaging around
00:54:12 - 00:54:16: 20 a day and he showed that last night
00:54:14 - 00:54:18: when he lied about every single thing he
00:54:16 - 00:54:19: talked about lying doesn't win debates
00:54:18 - 00:54:22: yeah but the problem is if you're going
00:54:19 - 00:54:24: to use lying or misleading the public
00:54:22 - 00:54:26: with statements against a candidate you
00:54:24 - 00:54:29: got to make sure your own candidate
00:54:26 - 00:54:31: speaks with unfed tongue I mean Biden
00:54:29 - 00:54:33: barely a week goes by without him saying
00:54:31 - 00:54:35: something which is immediately proven to
00:54:33 - 00:54:38: be untrue I mean only like two weeks ago
00:54:35 - 00:54:40: was claiming that his uncle was shot
00:54:38 - 00:54:42: down and eaten by cannibals none of it
00:54:40 - 00:54:44: ever happened it wasn't shot down and he
00:54:42 - 00:54:46: wasn't eaten by cannibals I mean I just
00:54:44 - 00:54:48: think that this idea that Trump's the
00:54:46 - 00:54:50: only one who who uh whose statements
00:54:48 - 00:54:53: can't be trusted is just not true last
00:54:50 - 00:54:55: night again and again and listen I'm not
00:54:53 - 00:54:57: denying that Trump made a series of of
00:54:55 - 00:54:59: untrue statements he does that he
00:54:57 - 00:55:01: barrels through and hopes that the big
00:54:59 - 00:55:03: messages about the border and so on Kick
00:55:01 - 00:55:05: home and they probably do actually with
00:55:03 - 00:55:09: many Americans but if Biden's going to
00:55:05 - 00:55:11: play the lying card as a pro Biden thing
00:55:09 - 00:55:13: against Trump he's got to tell the truth
00:55:11 - 00:55:15: and get his numbers right he can't then
00:55:13 - 00:55:18: have a fact check from CNN which was
00:55:15 - 00:55:20: painful to watch last night it went on
00:55:18 - 00:55:23: and on and on almost every statistic he
00:55:20 - 00:55:25: came out with was completely
00:55:23 - 00:55:27: wrong yeah but Pierce I mean let's be
00:55:25 - 00:55:30: real here like if you're you see one sec
00:55:27 - 00:55:32: Vinnie you look like a relax buddy uh if
00:55:30 - 00:55:33: you're getting a number incorrect right
00:55:32 - 00:55:37: if you're getting a number incorrect
00:55:33 - 00:55:39: that's like s years ago years done I'm
00:55:37 - 00:55:41: not done years were you 10 years old
00:55:39 - 00:55:43: Harry how old were you when Trump won 10
00:55:41 - 00:55:47: years old years ago
00:55:43 - 00:55:49: you what the hell you're talking about
00:55:47 - 00:55:52: takeing
00:55:49 - 00:55:53: have listen listen I know his son's a
00:55:52 - 00:55:54: big fan of mine he was right to call you
00:55:53 - 00:55:56: out for looking like you're about to
00:55:54 - 00:56:00: explode it's okay no problem here yeah
00:55:56 - 00:56:02: you 10 years old to level har and you
00:56:00 - 00:56:03: and what are you like 80 like relax
00:56:02 - 00:56:07: buddy take a breather you're okay I
00:56:03 - 00:56:07: promise that was so
00:56:08 - 00:56:13: good I just say it doesn't I don't
00:56:11 - 00:56:15: actually care how old either of you are
00:56:13 - 00:56:17: let's get back to the real reality which
00:56:15 - 00:56:20: is I care about the age of the president
00:56:17 - 00:56:21: because he looks like he's 180 so Harry
00:56:20 - 00:56:23: I'm
00:56:21 - 00:56:28: just 33% of people watching it
00:56:23 - 00:56:28: apparently think B I don't know
00:56:28 - 00:56:33: I don't know how anybody honestly could
00:56:30 - 00:56:35: watch that debate and honestly conclude
00:56:33 - 00:56:38: that Biden won you'd have to be so
00:56:35 - 00:56:40: deeply embedded in the Democrat partisan
00:56:38 - 00:56:42: tank that you can't crawl out long
00:56:40 - 00:56:45: enough to see the wood for the
00:56:42 - 00:56:47: trees so first thing I want to respond
00:56:45 - 00:56:49: to your lie comment I I I think that
00:56:47 - 00:56:51: yeah we want both candidates to be
00:56:49 - 00:56:53: honest but we have to weigh the the lies
00:56:51 - 00:56:55: here like if Joe Biden gets a statistic
00:56:53 - 00:56:57: incorrect that is vastly different than
00:56:55 - 00:56:59: Donald Donald Trump still pushing lies
00:56:57 - 00:57:00: about January 6th and about the election
00:56:59 - 00:57:02: so that's first and foremost but second
00:57:00 - 00:57:04: of all as I said the substance of the
00:57:02 - 00:57:06: conversation is what matters Trump can
00:57:04 - 00:57:07: Scream the loudest he can lie the most
00:57:06 - 00:57:08: that doesn't mean you win a debate when
00:57:07 - 00:57:10: Joe Biden's up there saying like you
00:57:08 - 00:57:11: know what my policy is pragmatic I want
00:57:10 - 00:57:13: to give women their Reproductive Rights
00:57:11 - 00:57:14: I want to continue to lower healthcare
00:57:13 - 00:57:15: costs I want to expand healthcare for
00:57:14 - 00:57:18: veterans more and more that's pragmatic
00:57:15 - 00:57:20: policy that's logical problem okay Harry
00:57:18 - 00:57:23: here the problem substance Harry here's
00:57:20 - 00:57:26: the problem he couldn't articulate his
00:57:23 - 00:57:28: views in a way that anyone could really
00:57:26 - 00:57:31: understand and secondly and More
00:57:28 - 00:57:34: crucially in Trump he has an opponent
00:57:31 - 00:57:35: who tells a lot of untruths and what you
00:57:34 - 00:57:37: want the president of the United States
00:57:35 - 00:57:40: to do is to be quick-witted enough and
00:57:37 - 00:57:42: sharp enough and intelligent enough to
00:57:40 - 00:57:44: every time he does that leap on it and
00:57:42 - 00:57:46: tell the American people why what he
00:57:44 - 00:57:48: said was untrue Biden was simply
00:57:46 - 00:57:50: incapable of doing any of that and
00:57:48 - 00:57:52: that's what a lot of Democrats have said
00:57:50 - 00:57:54: overnight is the most problematic thing
00:57:52 - 00:57:56: it's not that he's old or anything it's
00:57:54 - 00:57:59: that he was incapable of
00:57:56 - 00:58:02: either articulating policy in a way that
00:57:59 - 00:58:04: resonated uh or holding Trump to account
00:58:02 - 00:58:07: and if you can't do that with with a
00:58:04 - 00:58:11: candidate like Trump there's no
00:58:07 - 00:58:12: hope yeah except here that was the the
00:58:11 - 00:58:14: method that Biden was hang on a I'll
00:58:12 - 00:58:16: come to you in one sec let Harry respond
00:58:14 - 00:58:18: to that sorry all right what I was gonna
00:58:16 - 00:58:20: say is if that's the method that Biden
00:58:18 - 00:58:22: was going to go with then all of his all
00:58:20 - 00:58:24: of his answers would just be
00:58:22 - 00:58:25: factchecking Trump every two minute he
00:58:24 - 00:58:26: asked he us be like okay Trump lied
00:58:25 - 00:58:29: about this this this and that's not uh
00:58:26 - 00:58:30: any way to win a voter over Biden it's I
00:58:29 - 00:58:32: I would think it's more of the
00:58:30 - 00:58:33: moderator's job to fact check as opposed
00:58:32 - 00:58:35: to Biden dedicating his entire debate to
00:58:33 - 00:58:37: fact cheing Biden should be laying out
00:58:35 - 00:58:38: the policy which he did uh he seemed
00:58:37 - 00:58:40: pretty coherent when he called out
00:58:38 - 00:58:43: Donald Trump for assaulting and raping
00:58:40 - 00:58:46: egene Carroll and being think
00:58:43 - 00:58:48: okay excruciating moment when Joe Biden
00:58:46 - 00:58:50: basically froze and mumbled his words
00:58:48 - 00:58:52: said complete gibberish and then Donald
00:58:50 - 00:58:54: Trump just said I don't think even he
00:58:52 - 00:58:55: knows what he just said do let's just
00:58:54 - 00:58:58: watch this clip and I'm going to ask you
00:58:55 - 00:59:00: to explain to me what he
00:58:58 - 00:59:02: said dealing with everything we have to
00:59:00 - 00:59:04: do with
00:59:02 - 00:59:07: uh
00:59:04 - 00:59:09: look if he doesn't care he doesn't like
00:59:07 - 00:59:11: the military at all and he doesn't care
00:59:09 - 00:59:13: about our veterans nobody been worse I
00:59:11 - 00:59:16: had the highest approval rating for
00:59:13 - 00:59:21: veterans taking care of the
00:59:16 - 00:59:24: VA I mean Harry what was Biden saying
00:59:21 - 00:59:26: there uh I it's a very nice uh
00:59:24 - 00:59:27: selectively edited clip I like it uh
00:59:26 - 00:59:30: yeah I don't think that every person
00:59:27 - 00:59:32: ever is going to speak perfectly so
00:59:30 - 00:59:33: highlighting B not speaking perfectly I
00:59:32 - 00:59:35: watched the whole thing Harry I watch
00:59:33 - 00:59:37: the whole thing I watch the whole 90
00:59:35 - 00:59:39: minutes I don't come at this as on the
00:59:37 - 00:59:41: left or right I'm not a member of either
00:59:39 - 00:59:43: party I don't promote either party over
00:59:41 - 00:59:45: the other I simply comeing it as a
00:59:43 - 00:59:47: journalist I didn't understand 90% of
00:59:45 - 00:59:49: what Biden was saying I did understand
00:59:47 - 00:59:51: Trump and understood that he was
00:59:49 - 00:59:53: misleading me a lot of the time but also
00:59:51 - 00:59:55: understood on the big picture messaging
00:59:53 - 00:59:56: which he kept ramming down the viewers
00:59:55 - 00:59:58: throat
00:59:56 - 01:00:01: about the chaos at the border the state
00:59:58 - 01:00:03: of the economy particularly on black
01:00:01 - 01:00:06: Americans and Latino Americans who had
01:00:03 - 01:00:09: gravitating to Trump and so on and so on
01:00:06 - 01:00:11: on those big picture messages he was
01:00:09 - 01:00:13: hitting home hard I don't know what
01:00:11 - 01:00:16: Biden's messages were I don't know what
01:00:13 - 01:00:17: he what he was talking about Pierce did
01:00:16 - 01:00:19: you not understand President Biden when
01:00:17 - 01:00:21: he talked about how the pack act now has
01:00:19 - 01:00:22: a million people signing up for it
01:00:21 - 01:00:26: getting you not understand him do you
01:00:22 - 01:00:28: not understand him when he talk about
01:00:26 - 01:00:30: no cuz he spoke in a weird look I'd
01:00:28 - 01:00:32: understood it if you had basically
01:00:30 - 01:00:35: translated him in real time I'd have
01:00:32 - 01:00:37: understood it if Gavin yum had done the
01:00:35 - 01:00:39: translation for us and articulated what
01:00:37 - 01:00:41: Biden was trying to say I'd have
01:00:39 - 01:00:45: understood it but Biden spoke for 90
01:00:41 - 01:00:48: minutes in a croaky monotone Dron likee
01:00:45 - 01:00:50: manner that honestly to for most average
01:00:48 - 01:00:52: viewers watching was utterly
01:00:50 - 01:00:54: incomprehensible and the problem he's
01:00:52 - 01:00:57: got is that Trump sounded and looked
01:00:54 - 01:00:59: exactly like he did in 2020 and 2016
01:00:57 - 01:01:01: like he's always done oh come on yeah he
01:00:59 - 01:01:03: did he did not he did not sound exactly
01:01:01 - 01:01:06: like he did in 2020 I promise you go
01:01:03 - 01:01:08: back and watch Trump 201 go back and
01:01:06 - 01:01:10: watch Trump in 2016 compared to last
01:01:08 - 01:01:13: night it's the same guy you may not like
01:01:10 - 01:01:15: him but he's and he's an embellisher and
01:01:13 - 01:01:17: he'll tell lies but he'll Ram home the
01:01:15 - 01:01:19: messages and one of his Trump cars
01:01:17 - 01:01:21: literally is that he can hit home
01:01:19 - 01:01:23: messaging in a way that resonates with
01:01:21 - 01:01:25: people at
01:01:23 - 01:01:28: home yeah it's certainly not the same
01:01:25 - 01:01:29: guy when the Trump 2024 okay uh the
01:01:28 - 01:01:31: trump in 2024 is talking about boats
01:01:29 - 01:01:33: sinking and like sharks and batteries
01:01:31 - 01:01:35: and all that stuff and he's you know
01:01:33 - 01:01:36: telling these insane lies about the
01:01:35 - 01:01:38: election I mean 2020 was claiming that
01:01:36 - 01:01:40: China was bringing in bamboo ballots I
01:01:38 - 01:01:41: mean this is like your crazy uncle at
01:01:40 - 01:01:43: Thanksgiving who's screaming in the
01:01:41 - 01:01:45: corner this is not a presidential
01:01:43 - 01:01:46: candidate this a dude who just Rambles
01:01:45 - 01:01:48: incoherently on the debate stage as he
01:01:46 - 01:01:50: did last night and do you believe Harry
01:01:48 - 01:01:51: finally do you believe in your heart
01:01:50 - 01:01:54: that Joe Biden is the right person to
01:01:51 - 01:01:57: lead the Democrats into the election in
01:01:54 - 01:01:59: November and do you believe he can
01:01:57 - 01:02:01: win uh he can win he's going to win and
01:01:59 - 01:02:04: as vice president Harris said we don't
01:02:01 - 01:02:06: let a 90minut performance negate three
01:02:04 - 01:02:07: and a half years of progress Biden's the
01:02:06 - 01:02:08: only man who has beaten Donald Trump and
01:02:07 - 01:02:09: he's going to do it again and I'm
01:02:08 - 01:02:11: looking forward to convicted felon
01:02:09 - 01:02:14: Donald Trump facing Justice why are you
01:02:11 - 01:02:17: the only person I've heard in the last
01:02:14 - 01:02:19: 24 hours who's not crying because the
01:02:17 - 01:02:21: performance was so
01:02:19 - 01:02:22: horrendous on my Democrat side I don't
01:02:21 - 01:02:24: know you have to talk to the people that
01:02:22 - 01:02:27: you're surrounded
01:02:24 - 01:02:29: by Frank bruny and all the all the
01:02:27 - 01:02:31: Democrat all the Democrat supporting
01:02:29 - 01:02:33: writers for the New York Times and so on
01:02:31 - 01:02:35: literally all of them van Jones areena
01:02:33 - 01:02:37: they're all crying because it was so bad
01:02:35 - 01:02:39: it brought tears to their eyes you
01:02:37 - 01:02:41: appear to have watched a completely
01:02:39 - 01:02:43: different debate you're you're happy you
01:02:41 - 01:02:46: thought it was great he's going to win a
01:02:43 - 01:02:47: triumphant Victory no he's not Harry

01:02:47 - 01:02:51: up yeah I I don't have the mentality of
01:02:49 - 01:02:53: like oh something didn't go our way now
01:02:51 - 01:02:55: we have to pout and cry I have the
01:02:53 - 01:02:56: mentality of well if something didn't go
01:02:55 - 01:02:57: our way and that's the way it's
01:02:56 - 01:02:59: perceived let's get to work get out

01:03:03 - 01:03:06: own sadness let's get to work as opposed
01:03:05 - 01:03:07: to writing in the New York Times that it
01:03:06 - 01:03:09: didn't go the way we wanted it I
01:03:07 - 01:03:11: actually I agree with you actually that
01:03:09 - 01:03:12: is a right response and I admire that
01:03:11 - 01:03:13: attitude so thank you for joining me
01:03:12 - 01:03:15: Harry thank you very much we're joining
01:03:13 - 01:03:17: me now as a Republican National
01:03:15 - 01:03:19: Committee spokeswoman Elizabeth pip har
01:03:17 - 01:03:21: wants Trump to win I just want that to
01:03:19 - 01:03:23: be clear Elizabeth uh thank you very
01:03:21 - 01:03:27: much for joining me I'd imagine you're
01:03:23 - 01:03:27: extremely happy today
01:03:28 - 01:03:32: um no I'm not extremely happy actually
01:03:30 - 01:03:34: um I'm extremely happy for Donald Trump
01:03:32 - 01:03:36: I think uh you'd agreed that he had a
01:03:34 - 01:03:37: resounding win last night but I'm
01:03:36 - 01:03:39: actually really upset I'm upset for the
01:03:37 - 01:03:41: country um it was not a good night
01:03:39 - 01:03:43: obviously for Joe Biden or the Democrat
01:03:41 - 01:03:45: Party but it wasn't a really good night
01:03:43 - 01:03:47: at all for the American people we just
01:03:45 - 01:03:49: had um I believe his name was Mo a
01:03:47 - 01:03:50: former Biden adviser I was listening to
01:03:49 - 01:03:52: your show and he said that this was a
01:03:50 - 01:03:55: blunder right a blunder on the the part
01:03:52 - 01:03:56: of his campaign to have him out there on
01:03:55 - 01:03:58: the debates stage I'm wondering why it's
01:03:56 - 01:04:00: a blunder to have him on the debate
01:03:58 - 01:04:02: stage but not a blunder to have him
01:04:00 - 01:04:04: leading the country for the last almost
01:04:02 - 01:04:07: four years it is a really sad time we're
01:04:04 - 01:04:09: in unchartered territory um it's almost
01:04:07 - 01:04:11: like we are a ship in horrible Waters
01:04:09 - 01:04:12: without a captain and somehow it's the
01:04:11 - 01:04:14: first time the American people are
01:04:12 - 01:04:16: allowed in on that secret it's a
01:04:14 - 01:04:18: horrible time in this country and I I
01:04:16 - 01:04:20: really can't believe that we're here you
01:04:18 - 01:04:21: know I almost believes you when you said
01:04:20 - 01:04:24: you were sad
01:04:21 - 01:04:25: there I Pro Pierce I don't know if you
01:04:24 - 01:04:28: know my story my parents are immigrants
01:04:25 - 01:04:30: to this country I I swear to you this is
01:04:28 - 01:04:32: genuinely a sad time for people like me
01:04:30 - 01:04:33: no one wants this right my mom was
01:04:32 - 01:04:36: crying last night she's a supporter
01:04:33 - 01:04:37: president Trump this is a rough time who
01:04:36 - 01:04:39: wants to watch that it wasn't just van
01:04:37 - 01:04:41: Jones it was people around the world by
01:04:39 - 01:04:42: the way who support this country and
01:04:41 - 01:04:44: everything that at stands for no one
01:04:42 - 01:04:46: wants to see the commander-in-chief of
01:04:44 - 01:04:47: the United States of America embarrassed
01:04:46 - 01:04:49: the way that he was last I mean look I
01:04:47 - 01:04:51: listen I felt sad too actually and I
01:04:49 - 01:04:52: agree with you about that I'm just if
01:04:51 - 01:04:55: I'm the Republican National Committee
01:04:52 - 01:04:57: spokeswoman I'm pretending to be sad on
01:04:55 - 01:04:59: camera and interviews but quietly I'm
01:04:57 - 01:05:01: doing a
01:04:59 - 01:05:05: Congo well I don't know how to Congo but
01:05:01 - 01:05:08: no genuinely I teach me sometime never
01:05:05 - 01:05:09: in my life but no I am an American first
01:05:08 - 01:05:10: and this was a rough night I think
01:05:09 - 01:05:12: anyone that watched it would agree with
01:05:10 - 01:05:14: that but no it's a great night for
01:05:12 - 01:05:16: Donald Trump to prove himself uh to
01:05:14 - 01:05:17: prove to the American people that he is
01:05:16 - 01:05:19: the obvious choice in November but that
01:05:17 - 01:05:21: does not mean that we don't have to
01:05:19 - 01:05:22: think about who has been leading this
01:05:21 - 01:05:24: country the last nearly four years and
01:05:22 - 01:05:26: who's going to lead it through November
01:05:24 - 01:05:28: right who keeps you awake at I thinking
01:05:26 - 01:05:30: they might replace Biden before the
01:05:28 - 01:05:32: election is that is there someone that
01:05:30 - 01:05:34: you just slightly apprehensive about you
01:05:32 - 01:05:36: think actually that could cause US
01:05:34 - 01:05:37: problems it's a it's a good question
01:05:36 - 01:05:39: that's all people talk about right for
01:05:37 - 01:05:40: the last three and a half years now we
01:05:39 - 01:05:42: know they're actually serious about it
01:05:40 - 01:05:43: I've heard Michelle Obama's name quite a
01:05:42 - 01:05:46: bit I do not believe she would do it I
01:05:43 - 01:05:47: believe she's incredibly popular but I
01:05:46 - 01:05:49: genuinely do not believe anyone could be
01:05:47 - 01:05:51: Donald Trump right now because as we
01:05:49 - 01:05:52: know based on last night it's not Joe
01:05:51 - 01:05:54: Biden that's been leading this country
01:05:52 - 01:05:56: it's actually just Democrat policies and
01:05:54 - 01:05:58: the people clearly show that they don't
01:05:56 - 01:06:00: want those policies anymore and they
01:05:58 - 01:06:02: want Donald Trump back in uh the White
01:06:00 - 01:06:04: House have you spoken to president Trump
01:06:02 - 01:06:06: today I have not spoken to him but I've
01:06:04 - 01:06:09: spoken to a lot of members of our team
01:06:06 - 01:06:12: obviously and how how is the general
01:06:09 - 01:06:13: mood it is it's a good day to work for
01:06:12 - 01:06:16: Donald Trump it certainly is so you've
01:06:13 - 01:06:19: all dried your tears long enough to
01:06:16 - 01:06:21: celebrate well we don't cry over here
01:06:19 - 01:06:24: but yeah look the the Fight Continues
01:06:21 - 01:06:26: obviously uh it's I've worked for Donald
01:06:24 - 01:06:28: Trump on it off since 2016 so we know
01:06:26 - 01:06:29: that there are good days and bad days
01:06:28 - 01:06:31: but the Fight Continues through November
01:06:29 - 01:06:32: 5th no matter what happens will he do
01:06:31 - 01:06:34: another debate I mean there's a lot of
01:06:32 - 01:06:35: speculation that he just won't bother
01:06:34 - 01:06:37: why would he I mean one and done right I
01:06:35 - 01:06:39: mean would he do another debate
01:06:37 - 01:06:41: particularly if there's a new nominee
01:06:39 - 01:06:43: that's not Joe Biden would he agree to
01:06:41 - 01:06:46: maybe do a debate with someone like
01:06:43 - 01:06:48: Gavin Nome if he turns out to replace
01:06:46 - 01:06:50: him I definitely think so look Donald
01:06:48 - 01:06:52: Trump has said for months now that he
01:06:50 - 01:06:53: would debate Joe Biden any place anytime
01:06:52 - 01:06:55: anywhere and that's because he thinks
01:06:53 - 01:06:56: the American people deserve it right
01:06:55 - 01:06:58: this is how well that's Joe Biden but
01:06:56 - 01:06:59: what about if it wasn't Joe Biden what
01:06:58 - 01:07:02: about somebody a lot younger and more
01:06:59 - 01:07:04: Dynamic would he be as Keen to expose
01:07:02 - 01:07:06: himself potentially to a more difficult
01:07:04 - 01:07:09: debate I do believe that he would be I
01:07:06 - 01:07:10: think he'd be ready to take on whoever
01:07:09 - 01:07:12: the Democrats choose to replace Joe
01:07:10 - 01:07:15: Biden with Elizabeth PCO thank you very
01:07:12 - 01:07:18: much indeed thank you let's go back to
01:07:15 - 01:07:19: the panel uh Chen your your response to
01:07:18 - 01:07:21: I mean look the Republicans they're
01:07:19 - 01:07:22: pretending to be sad of course they're
01:07:21 - 01:07:24: not sad they're absolutely jubilant
01:07:22 - 01:07:26: because it couldn't have possibly gone
01:07:24 - 01:07:28: any better
01:07:26 - 01:07:31: I mean every headline from the moment
01:07:28 - 01:07:32: that debate was over is catastrophe for
01:07:31 - 01:07:35: the
01:07:32 - 01:07:37: Democrats yeah except there's one giant
01:07:35 - 01:07:39: caveat to that which swallows up what
01:07:37 - 01:07:41: you're saying Pierce which is that the
01:07:39 - 01:07:44: night was so terrible for Biden that it
01:07:41 - 01:07:47: wound up being terrible for Trump um the
01:07:44 - 01:07:49: reason is Biden can't continue they put
01:07:47 - 01:07:51: out that lunatic statement that you uh
01:07:49 - 01:07:53: read earlier in the state in the show
01:07:51 - 01:07:56: about how he's going to continue and how
01:07:53 - 01:07:57: he's a Dynamo and all that stuff no the
01:07:56 - 01:07:59: only person who believes that is your
01:07:57 - 01:08:02: earlier guest Harry who apparently has
01:07:59 - 01:08:05: lost his mind and wants Trump to win
01:08:02 - 01:08:08: right like who if if we keep Biden in
01:08:05 - 01:08:10: the race a trump Victory is guaranteed
01:08:08 - 01:08:12: look when I said that Biden had a near
01:08:10 - 01:08:14: zero chance of winning everybody went
01:08:12 - 01:08:16: crazy and I you know I said that six
01:08:14 - 01:08:19: months ago nine months ago oh you that's
01:08:16 - 01:08:21: nuts he's got a 55 60% I'm like you guys
01:08:19 - 01:08:24: are living in an alternate reality it
01:08:21 - 01:08:26: was always obvious how old he was it was
01:08:24 - 01:08:28: always obvious that he couldn't do this
01:08:26 - 01:08:29: and I want to thank who whichever
01:08:28 - 01:08:32: Democrat made the decision to put this
01:08:29 - 01:08:33: before the convention because thank God
01:08:32 - 01:08:35: the debate was before the convention so
01:08:33 - 01:08:37: we could pick someone else if you say at
01:08:35 - 01:08:39: this point that we shouldn't pick a
01:08:37 - 01:08:41: different candidate you're saying I'm
01:08:39 - 01:08:43: super happy to have Donald Trump as
01:08:41 - 01:08:44: president and have him destroy this
01:08:43 - 01:08:47: democracy it's a betrayal of the
01:08:44 - 01:08:49: democratic party but right now the RNC
01:08:47 - 01:08:50: should be panicking not celebrating
01:08:49 - 01:08:51: because they're going to get a new
01:08:50 - 01:08:54: candidate and that new candidate is
01:08:51 - 01:08:56: going to kick Trump's ass that debate
01:08:54 - 01:08:58: turned out to be a disaster for for both
01:08:56 - 01:09:01: of the candidates okay uh Vinnie I can
01:08:58 - 01:09:04: see you not entirely agreeing with that
01:09:01 - 01:09:06: assessment I well because I'm just I'm
01:09:04 - 01:09:09: just so Cur like what threat to
01:09:06 - 01:09:11: democracy why didn't he do and burn the
01:09:09 - 01:09:12: country down when he was the president
01:09:11 - 01:09:15: what what why why didn't he all that
01:09:12 - 01:09:17: Putin stuff all that BS it's all these
01:09:15 - 01:09:19: Democrats you guys all have Stockholm
01:09:17 - 01:09:21: syndrome okay you guys have all fallen
01:09:19 - 01:09:22: in love with your abuser and the abuser
01:09:21 - 01:09:24: is the Democratic party they don't give
01:09:22 - 01:09:26: a [ __ ] about you they don't care they
01:09:24 - 01:09:28: don't care wheel out whoever you want
01:09:26 - 01:09:29: it's going to be the same polies
01:09:28 - 01:09:31: everything everything that's happening
01:09:29 - 01:09:32: right now is going to keep happening
01:09:31 - 01:09:34: what's going to change you had Harry
01:09:32 - 01:09:36: come on here the kid what what was he 10
01:09:34 - 01:09:37: years old eight years old he's talking
01:09:36 - 01:09:39: about like he's lived the life and he
01:09:37 - 01:09:41: knows what's talking about and and for
01:09:39 - 01:09:43: us for nobody to talk up what's so good
01:09:41 - 01:09:46: about Joe what has Joe Biden done can
01:09:43 - 01:09:48: anybody give me one thing and don't say
01:09:46 - 01:09:50: infrastructure it's absolute [ __ ] show
01:09:48 - 01:09:53: and it's not him running the show as we
01:09:50 - 01:09:55: saw yesterday hold on it's the them it's
01:09:53 - 01:09:58: the them it's the them when I think
01:09:55 - 01:10:01: Hassan wants to give you one thing
01:09:58 - 01:10:03: Hassan it's not even just one thing
01:10:01 - 01:10:05: here's the problem okay I don't even
01:10:03 - 01:10:08: like I don't like Joe Biden he went from
01:10:05 - 01:10:11: Jim Crow Joe to genocide Joe and uh he
01:10:08 - 01:10:14: is a monstrous person for the most part
01:10:11 - 01:10:16: as are many American presidents having
01:10:14 - 01:10:19: said that however one of the key factors
01:10:16 - 01:10:22: here is that the administration is
01:10:19 - 01:10:25: competent I use the example of Twitter
01:10:22 - 01:10:28: right Twitter used to be run by uh
01:10:25 - 01:10:30: liberal Jack dorsy right that's his name
01:10:28 - 01:10:32: I think I can't really remember and it
01:10:30 - 01:10:34: wasn't exactly the greatest website it
01:10:32 - 01:10:38: wasn't it wasn't the best website it
01:10:34 - 01:10:40: still had a Litany of issues right still
01:10:38 - 01:10:43: breaking people's brains but at least it
01:10:40 - 01:10:45: functioned and then Elon Musk took over
01:10:43 - 01:10:48: and we saw exactly what happened to
01:10:45 - 01:10:51: Twitter it is now a a right-wing [ __ ]
01:10:48 - 01:10:54: hole filled to the brim with Gore porn
01:10:51 - 01:10:55: and just the worst imaginable positions
01:10:54 - 01:10:57: that you've ever heard and just open
01:10:55 - 01:10:59: white supremacist Nazis getting hundreds
01:10:57 - 01:11:01: of thousands of likes and that's
01:10:59 - 01:11:03: basically the difference between at
01:11:01 - 01:11:05: least like a democratic Administration
01:11:03 - 01:11:08: which does fill the agencies you have
01:11:05 - 01:11:12: the nlrb doing phenomenal work you have
01:11:08 - 01:11:15: uh Lena Khan uh doing phenominal work at
01:11:12 - 01:11:18: FTC you have the EPA at least relatively
01:11:15 - 01:11:20: competent these are all issues that are
01:11:18 - 01:11:21: going to become massive complications
01:11:20 - 01:11:24: down the line when you have something
01:11:21 - 01:11:27: like project 2025 openly talking about
01:11:24 - 01:11:30: abolishing the the uh Department of
01:11:27 - 01:11:32: Education abolishing the EPA like and
01:11:30 - 01:11:34: that's precisely why people like Jen and
01:11:32 - 01:11:36: myself who are not exactly big fans of
01:11:34 - 01:11:39: Joe Biden and haven't you know haven't
01:11:36 - 01:11:41: shied away from criticism see the
01:11:39 - 01:11:43: writing on the wall see exactly how
01:11:41 - 01:11:45: damaging someone like Donald Trump's
01:11:43 - 01:11:47: second term is going to look like and
01:11:45 - 01:11:49: and see how damaging Republican policies
01:11:47 - 01:11:51: have become and how reactionary the
01:11:49 - 01:11:53: Republican party has become even more
01:11:51 - 01:11:56: reactionary than before I mean I would
01:11:53 - 01:11:59: also say that what
01:11:56 - 01:12:01: that hang on hang on don't talk once
01:11:59 - 01:12:03: I'll come to you I think you fit on
01:12:01 - 01:12:05: something though which is it was not
01:12:03 - 01:12:08: only Biden's inability to hold Trump to
01:12:05 - 01:12:11: account for the lies he was telling but
01:12:08 - 01:12:12: also his inability to sell himself and
01:12:11 - 01:12:14: what he's achieved because there are
01:12:12 - 01:12:17: achievements there abut but actually
01:12:14 - 01:12:19: he's been in incapable Gavin nusum in
01:12:17 - 01:12:22: that one minute clip I showed earlier
01:12:19 - 01:12:24: was able to articulate better
01:12:22 - 01:12:26: achievements by Biden than Biden's been
01:12:24 - 01:12:28: able to do that's why Biden's approval
01:12:26 - 01:12:29: rating is in the tanker like 37% Jenner
01:12:28 - 01:12:31: I want to bring you in here for a kind
01:12:29 - 01:12:34: of a summary of where we are with this
01:12:31 - 01:12:36: what do you think happens
01:12:34 - 01:12:39: now yeah well I mean I I think what's
01:12:36 - 01:12:40: remarkable that we've seen in just the
01:12:39 - 01:12:42: last 12 hours since the debate is that
01:12:40 - 01:12:45: the Democrats are finally telling the
01:12:42 - 01:12:46: truth and I give them credit for that
01:12:45 - 01:12:49: better late than never they are actually
01:12:46 - 01:12:51: looking at their candidate and openly
01:12:49 - 01:12:53: saying guys we've got to figure out a
01:12:51 - 01:12:56: solution here and the Republicans are
01:12:53 - 01:12:57: not doing that with Donald Trump and I
01:12:56 - 01:13:00: would just like to say as someone who
01:12:57 - 01:13:03: for a lot of personal cost has stood up
01:13:00 - 01:13:05: and told the truth about Donald Trump I
01:13:03 - 01:13:06: think that the Republicans need to do
01:13:05 - 01:13:09: the same thing and if everyone in
01:13:06 - 01:13:12: America was willing to actually stand up
01:13:09 - 01:13:14: on both sides and tell the truth about
01:13:12 - 01:13:16: both of these individuals we would have
01:13:14 - 01:13:18: better people running for office from
01:13:16 - 01:13:21: the top all the way down and so this is
01:13:18 - 01:13:23: about a power grab from both sides and
01:13:21 - 01:13:24: so I think where we're at right now is
01:13:23 - 01:13:26: that Donald Trump should be very
01:13:24 - 01:13:27: concerned about the debate last night
01:13:26 - 01:13:29: because the Democrats are going to
01:13:27 - 01:13:31: replace Joe Biden and they're telling
01:13:29 - 01:13:33: the truth about their candidate and
01:13:31 - 01:13:35: that's going to be detrimental to his
01:13:33 - 01:13:36: campaign Republicans aren't doing that
01:13:35 - 01:13:37: right now there are definitely people
01:13:36 - 01:13:39: that I've talked to even in the
01:13:37 - 01:13:41: Republican party I know the spokesperson
01:13:39 - 01:13:42: isn't willing to admit it that have very
01:13:41 - 01:13:43: serious concerns about Donald Trump I
01:13:42 - 01:13:45: would encourage everyone to go and read
01:13:43 - 01:13:48: the letter that I wrote to the Colorado
01:13:45 - 01:13:50: bar about my concerns of Donald Trump
01:13:48 - 01:13:51: because I was there and I saw all of it
01:13:50 - 01:13:53: and I was willing to stand up and tell
01:13:51 - 01:13:55: the truth and nobody in the Republican
01:13:53 - 01:13:57: party has been willing to stand and say
01:13:55 - 01:13:58: that that is a detriment to our country
01:13:57 - 01:14:01: so I give the
01:13:58 - 01:14:03: Democrats just honestly a lot of credit
01:14:01 - 01:14:05: for actually saying this guy cannot
01:14:03 - 01:14:07: continue I hope that they replace him
01:14:05 - 01:14:09: with someone else and I think Michelle
01:14:07 - 01:14:11: Obama actually is the one that I would
01:14:09 - 01:14:12: she would be she would be an amazing
01:14:11 - 01:14:14: candidate but she doesn't want to do it
01:14:12 - 01:14:16: apparently uh and look you say you give
01:14:14 - 01:14:18: them credit they haven't done it yet
01:14:16 - 01:14:19: let's wait and see because the big
01:14:18 - 01:14:21: question now but they're saying they're
01:14:19 - 01:14:23: talking about it they're talking about
01:14:21 - 01:14:26: it which is definitely very unusual and
01:14:23 - 01:14:30: it's a huge public pressure
01:14:26 - 01:14:31: it's a huge public pressure but remember
01:14:30 - 01:14:33: I think what they should just do is tell
01:14:31 - 01:14:35: Biden hey you've already agreed to step
01:14:33 - 01:14:37: down and he'll probably think oh yeah I
01:14:35 - 01:14:39: did thanks he'll just go away that's
01:14:37 - 01:14:41: that should be their plan sadly that is
01:14:39 - 01:14:43: actually probably true and that is the
01:14:41 - 01:14:44: problem right there in a nutshell thank
01:14:43 - 01:14:46: you to my panel much appreciate it
01:14:44 - 01:14:47: you've been with me a long time today
01:14:46 - 01:14:49: but it's a it's a moment in history I
01:14:47 - 01:14:52: feel I feel like what's going to happen
01:14:49 - 01:14:53: post this debate is historical and I'm
01:14:52 - 01:14:56: glad you were with me thank you very
01:14:53 - 01:14:56: much indeed
