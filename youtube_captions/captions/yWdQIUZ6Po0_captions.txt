00:17:08 - 00:17:11: seven out of ten yeah there's a lot of
00:17:10 - 00:17:14: movies that maybe i won't ever watch

00:17:34 - 00:17:38: uh wait no which is toy story three the
00:17:36 - 00:17:40: bad no toy story two is the bad one

00:17:40 - 00:17:44: prospects
00:17:42 - 00:17:44: yeah four was the bad one four is
00:17:44 - 00:17:46: probably the worst one they've been
00:17:44 - 00:17:48: worried no four's the best one what are
00:17:46 - 00:17:50: you talking about wait the one with you
00:17:48 - 00:17:53: we've talked about toy story rankings

00:17:53 - 00:17:57: dude this is our civil war
00:17:55 - 00:17:59: is the worst three wrapped it up in a
00:17:57 - 00:18:00: nice little bow four was just because
00:17:59 - 00:18:02: pixar is a bunch of money-grubbing
00:18:00 - 00:18:03: [ __ ] and they're like [ __ ] let's milk
00:18:02 - 00:18:05: another
00:18:03 - 00:18:07: episode a little another episode i don't
00:18:05 - 00:18:09: even think sam knows which one he's
00:18:07 - 00:18:15: arguing for is the one where it's just
00:18:09 - 00:18:15: like three i know my toy story lord okay
00:18:19 - 00:18:22: is like
00:18:20 - 00:18:24: he's realized that his [ __ ] kid's
00:18:22 - 00:18:29: going to keep getting older and then the
00:18:24 - 00:18:29: the little little bow beep is like a big
00:18:30 - 00:18:35: you know she's like a homeless
00:18:33 - 00:18:37: bed-rattled lady she she yeah she turns
00:18:35 - 00:18:38: into a woody gypsy
00:18:37 - 00:18:40: but he's like come on you want to come
00:18:38 - 00:18:41: up here in the high life you know i got
00:18:40 - 00:18:45: a place to live she's like nah i like
00:18:41 - 00:18:46: living in the bushes yeah basically
00:18:45 - 00:18:48: the how is that the best movie he
00:18:46 - 00:18:50: basically becomes a simple it becomes
00:18:48 - 00:18:53: homeless it's great yeah because the
00:18:50 - 00:18:55: homeless breaks breaks the girl's heart
00:18:53 - 00:18:56: becomes homeless i don't think it's bad
00:18:55 - 00:18:59: though i think it's just my least
00:18:56 - 00:19:01: favorite i also did fall asleep in the

00:22:55 - 00:22:59: that i went through the pregnancy aisle
00:22:57 - 00:23:02: yeah they got some like some thick
00:22:59 - 00:23:03: [ __ ] in there this how this man can
00:23:02 - 00:23:05: get pregnant
00:23:03 - 00:23:08: that'd be so scary to be born out of a
00:23:05 - 00:23:08: mannequin too like
00:23:09 - 00:23:13: all the mannequins are [ __ ] when the
00:23:11 - 00:23:16: store closes and just give birth to
00:23:13 - 00:23:18: another person [ __ ] it
00:23:16 - 00:23:19: and it's like some hybrid
00:23:18 - 00:23:21: wearing some sort of hat and sort of
00:23:19 - 00:23:22: like glasses
00:23:21 - 00:23:24: them
00:23:22 - 00:23:26: yeah it's just like assimilates into
00:23:24 - 00:23:30: society pretty well and one day gets on
00:23:26 - 00:23:30: a decently big podcast
00:23:30 - 00:23:36: wouldn't that be weird
00:23:33 - 00:23:36: that would be insane
00:23:39 - 00:23:42: you
00:23:40 - 00:23:45: would be very concerned
00:23:42 - 00:23:47: if you knew how long it took me to make
00:23:45 - 00:23:47: the
00:23:47 - 00:23:52: the connection between what brian was
00:23:49 - 00:23:52: saying in the background
00:23:54 - 00:23:57: that's why he kept going
00:23:58 - 00:24:01: look at him
00:24:03 - 00:24:06: yeah anyways oh yeah we're supposed to
00:24:05 - 00:24:10: ask you uh
00:24:06 - 00:24:12: like two weeks ago maybe like a week ago
00:24:10 - 00:24:16: you said you had a list of the hottest
00:24:12 - 00:24:16: members of x phil's family or something

00:24:18 - 00:24:22: are fighting and you like ran away and
00:24:21 - 00:24:24: then uh and then the more i thought

00:25:02 - 00:25:04: [ __ ] lightly
00:25:08 - 00:25:11: back down and he immediately pulls back
00:25:10 - 00:25:14: the old dog he's like whoa whoa back
00:25:11 - 00:25:14: whoa whoa
00:25:16 - 00:25:20: [Laughter]
00:25:22 - 00:25:25: the dog just looks like it's stuffed

00:27:36 - 00:27:39: yeah all three of us don't care we're
00:27:38 - 00:27:41: here
00:27:39 - 00:27:42: we're gonna click off this thing they're
00:27:41 - 00:27:45: stuck here right now until they're out
00:27:42 - 00:27:45: of the window
00:27:46 - 00:27:51: whatever comes in here and turns it off
00:27:49 - 00:27:53: that's what they're stuck with they know
00:27:51 - 00:27:54: this is what i don't care what they feel

00:27:54 - 00:27:59: oh my god
00:27:56 - 00:28:01: how do deaf people or not deaf people oh
00:27:59 - 00:28:03: how do blind people like navigate the
00:28:01 - 00:28:04: internet do they even do that they dude
00:28:03 - 00:28:06: yeah they
00:28:04 - 00:28:07: should you not like
00:28:06 - 00:28:10: they are
00:28:07 - 00:28:13: i underestimated how much you know like
00:28:10 - 00:28:15: a blind person could do i guess before i
00:28:13 - 00:28:16: went to my internship and like in that
00:28:15 - 00:28:18: city there's
00:28:16 - 00:28:20: a ton of blind people everywhere and
00:28:18 - 00:28:23: there was one on my development there's
00:28:20 - 00:28:25: no city of the blind place no i'm just
00:28:23 - 00:28:26: saying i i think up until that point i
00:28:25 - 00:28:28: don't know if i'd ever seen a blind
00:28:26 - 00:28:30: person walking around like with a stick
00:28:28 - 00:28:31: like i just don't think i'd ever seen
00:28:30 - 00:28:33: that in real life
00:28:31 - 00:28:34: really and
00:28:33 - 00:28:36: and i [ __ ] went here and i was just
00:28:34 - 00:28:40: like oh my god
00:28:36 - 00:28:41: i was like hey look no i'm just kidding
00:28:40 - 00:28:43: i wasn't like freaking out but i was
00:28:41 - 00:28:44: just like oh that's like pretty cool i
00:28:43 - 00:28:46: wonder if the city is just like super
00:28:44 - 00:28:48: accessible or something like why there's
00:28:46 - 00:28:49: so many
00:28:48 - 00:28:52: you know how do we get them out of here
00:28:49 - 00:28:54: how do we make the city less accessible
00:28:52 - 00:28:57: no uh but yeah there was uh there's one
00:28:54 - 00:28:58: on my team and he was like insanely good
00:28:57 - 00:28:59: at coding
00:28:58 - 00:29:01: and just like
00:28:59 - 00:29:03: like he just would come to meetings and
00:29:01 - 00:29:06: just sit there
00:29:03 - 00:29:07: and like [ __ ] like i don't know how
00:29:06 - 00:29:09: he does it like they just listen to
00:29:07 - 00:29:11: stuff and they're like typing and
00:29:09 - 00:29:12: he's like going ham
00:29:11 - 00:29:14: to [ __ ] with him you're just like what
00:29:12 - 00:29:16: he's not when his hands are up you know
00:29:14 - 00:29:18: lightly you slightly shift the keyboard
00:29:16 - 00:29:20: a little bit to the left so that way
00:29:18 - 00:29:22: everything he's typing is just [ __ ]
00:29:20 - 00:29:24: gibberish yeah whenever he tries to let
00:29:22 - 00:29:25: her over i think he would know a little
00:29:24 - 00:29:27: bit he would somehow know how would he
00:29:25 - 00:29:28: do that
00:29:27 - 00:29:29: no i'm just telling you don't
00:29:28 - 00:29:31: underestimate them there's a lot they
00:29:29 - 00:29:33: can do really
00:29:31 - 00:29:36: yeah they're like almost like people
00:29:33 - 00:29:36: okay
00:29:37 - 00:29:41: there's gonna be like actually a blind
00:29:39 - 00:29:43: person listening that's just like we are
00:29:41 - 00:29:44: super curious because
00:29:43 - 00:29:47: you know until now we didn't even dare
00:29:44 - 00:29:48: to ask questions i i just assumed they
00:29:47 - 00:29:51: just sat there and waited for the
00:29:48 - 00:29:55: inevitable end at 80 years old
00:29:51 - 00:29:55: feed me
00:29:56 - 00:29:59: all right no place in this world
00:30:00 - 00:30:03: you guys should have played a joke you
00:30:02 - 00:30:04: should have gotten a keyboard of a
00:30:03 - 00:30:05: different language and just like plugged
00:30:04 - 00:30:08: it in
00:30:05 - 00:30:08: you just unplug yourself
00:30:15 - 00:30:20: wearing headphones a lot oh [ __ ] okay at
00:30:18 - 00:30:22: least one i don't know how it works but
00:30:20 - 00:30:26: they've got like future tech helping
00:30:22 - 00:30:28: these guys be better coders
00:30:26 - 00:30:29: are you impressed by deaf people are you
00:30:28 - 00:30:31: impressed by
00:30:29 - 00:30:32: or blind people are you impressed by the
00:30:31 - 00:30:35: the fact that they're like
00:30:32 - 00:30:37: so integrated with machines
00:30:35 - 00:30:38: more than us yeah it seems sorry i think
00:30:37 - 00:30:40: they're teaming up with the machines
00:30:38 - 00:30:43: like the blind people still suck it's
00:30:40 - 00:30:43: just the computers are awesome
00:30:43 - 00:30:49: regular eyeballs
00:30:45 - 00:30:52: no no [ __ ] you could not be like that
00:30:49 - 00:30:54: you couldn't [ __ ] like do his job
00:30:52 - 00:30:56: with a super computer you know like how
00:30:54 - 00:30:58: do you know the little computer smart
00:30:56 - 00:31:00: guy he's got little computer attachments
00:30:58 - 00:31:01: and stuff
00:31:00 - 00:31:02: hey
00:31:01 - 00:31:04: yeah yeah
00:31:02 - 00:31:05: he wasn't the only one i guess they're
00:31:04 - 00:31:07: all cheating though

00:31:07 - 00:31:11: yes
00:31:09 - 00:31:14: that's what they are every single blind
00:31:11 - 00:31:14: person is
00:31:15 - 00:31:17: cheating your way through life you've
00:31:16 - 00:31:21: got it easy
00:31:17 - 00:31:21: [Laughter]
00:31:27 - 00:31:32: [ __ ] how easy blind people got it
00:31:35 - 00:31:45: [Laughter]
00:31:44 - 00:31:47: oh that's like one of my biggest fears
00:31:45 - 00:31:49: is going blind like oh my god just don't
00:31:47 - 00:31:51: take care of my eyes super well like
00:31:49 - 00:31:53: these contacts are really old no i'd
00:31:51 - 00:31:54: rather go deaf i think oh for sure
00:31:53 - 00:31:55: definitely
00:31:54 - 00:31:59: but uh
00:31:55 - 00:31:59: definitely but uh
00:32:00 - 00:32:03: wow i don't want to get it going after

00:34:29 - 00:34:33: out of it like early before anything
00:34:30 - 00:34:35: creepy happens but i had had it before
00:34:33 - 00:34:36: where like i thought i felt someone like
00:34:35 - 00:34:38: grabbing my foot
00:34:36 - 00:34:40: and like i thought i could like see
00:34:38 - 00:34:42: something down like at the foot of my
00:34:40 - 00:34:44: bed but i was just like frozen it's
00:34:42 - 00:34:47: awful and i'm like my dog was next to me

00:35:06 - 00:35:10: luxury over here like
00:35:08 - 00:35:12: people are faking it yeah
00:35:10 - 00:35:13: i genuinely think

00:35:22 - 00:35:25: is the position i wake up in so
00:35:24 - 00:35:27: apparently you're more likely to when
00:35:25 - 00:35:28: you're on your back and i believe it
00:35:27 - 00:35:30: because whenever i did it was when i was
00:35:28 - 00:35:33: sleeping on chairs on my back
00:35:30 - 00:35:35: in a weird position so i think it's true

00:37:10 - 00:37:14: [ __ ] on steve but i'd like to see what
00:37:12 - 00:37:16: his house looks like if his car looks
00:37:14 - 00:37:18: like that yeah let's see his bedroom and
00:37:16 - 00:37:20: under his bed
00:37:18 - 00:37:22: well i've apparently had rotting floor
00:37:20 - 00:37:24: like he had nice hardwood
00:37:22 - 00:37:26: floors and like it was rotted so instead
00:37:24 - 00:37:27: of fixing the part that was rotted he
00:37:26 - 00:37:29: just straight up put laminate over it
00:37:27 - 00:37:30: like nothing happened
00:37:29 - 00:37:32: so
00:37:30 - 00:37:34: that's kind of an insight into his
00:37:32 - 00:37:35: decision making
00:37:34 - 00:37:37: all right

00:47:27 - 00:47:32: a repressed memory like in the future
00:47:31 - 00:47:34: like why well
00:47:32 - 00:47:38: my stickers are made for the kids you
00:47:34 - 00:47:38: know first and foremost
00:47:50 - 00:47:54: anyways he he was making me a coloring
00:47:52 - 00:47:55: book
00:47:54 - 00:47:57: yeah i heard about it like
00:47:55 - 00:47:59: two years ago maybe even longer like it
00:47:57 - 00:48:01: was forever ago he was making me a
00:47:59 - 00:48:05: coloring one and it was it was great it
00:48:01 - 00:48:06: was like he had uh like 20 pages
00:48:05 - 00:48:09: and it was like different
00:48:06 - 00:48:11: i guess like career highs for me you
00:48:09 - 00:48:13: know like just doing different [ __ ] and
00:48:11 - 00:48:15: they were too short excellently
00:48:13 - 00:48:17: illustrated and everything and he had
00:48:15 - 00:48:18: like 10 of them done
00:48:17 - 00:48:22: and then he just never contacted me
00:48:18 - 00:48:25: again why why
00:48:22 - 00:48:27: maybe he died dude i did it no no
00:48:25 - 00:48:28: he's around that's disappointing because
00:48:27 - 00:48:31: that would be dope i thought about that
00:48:28 - 00:48:32: before like just i would love to one day
00:48:31 - 00:48:35: just make a like
00:48:32 - 00:48:39: book of like mixed media you know like
00:48:35 - 00:48:40: freaks stickers like [ __ ] photos and
00:48:39 - 00:48:42: [ __ ] just like
00:48:40 - 00:48:45: like doodles that would be dope
00:48:42 - 00:48:46: but i'm sure it'd be expensive also
00:48:45 - 00:48:48: yeah that's one of those things where
00:48:46 - 00:48:51: when you make it you're
00:48:48 - 00:48:52: just looking to get your money back
00:48:51 - 00:48:54: and it's just kind of fan service more
00:48:52 - 00:48:56: than anything oh yeah no i think it'd
00:48:54 - 00:48:58: just be dope to have one yeah we looked
00:48:56 - 00:49:00: at the
00:48:58 - 00:49:01: at like the pricing and everything and i
00:49:00 - 00:49:04: was just like there really wasn't much
00:49:01 - 00:49:05: money 80 dollars a book here to me they
00:49:04 - 00:49:07: weren't expensive i wanted to offer them
00:49:05 - 00:49:08: for less than like 10 bucks like there's
00:49:07 - 00:49:10: no way someone's going to spend more
00:49:08 - 00:49:11: than that and so i don't know if people
00:49:10 - 00:49:14: would you would spend ten dollars on
00:49:11 - 00:49:16: that well i wanted to be cheap because
00:49:14 - 00:49:17: everything on the shop just because it's
00:49:16 - 00:49:19: drop shipping is expensive to begin with
00:49:17 - 00:49:20: because like you pay retail and then you
00:49:19 - 00:49:22: have to get it customized then you have
00:49:20 - 00:49:23: to get it shipped
00:49:22 - 00:49:25: this uh

00:52:00 - 00:52:04: three or four other times like one time
00:52:02 - 00:52:06: she went to go take a nap and then he he
00:52:04 - 00:52:07: just like lit a book on fire and like
00:52:06 - 00:52:09: put it at the base of the bedroom door
00:52:07 - 00:52:11: and just like ran out of the house
00:52:09 - 00:52:13: really quick
00:52:11 - 00:52:14: and he was like that didn't work so then
00:52:13 - 00:52:16: he was doing like roofing work and he
00:52:14 - 00:52:17: waited until she walked underneath where
00:52:16 - 00:52:20: he was he like
00:52:17 - 00:52:22: kicked the cinderblock off the roof onto
00:52:20 - 00:52:23: her head almost killed her
00:52:22 - 00:52:24: and then um
00:52:23 - 00:52:26: he was like all right these widely

00:54:47 - 00:54:49: yeah
00:54:50 - 00:54:52: yeah
00:54:51 - 00:54:54: you almost had a good idea with the
00:54:52 - 00:54:56: cinder block but besides that except for
00:54:54 - 00:54:58: like
00:54:56 - 00:54:58: a cinder block
00:55:00 - 00:55:04: a whole piano
00:55:02 - 00:55:05: grand piano up there
00:55:04 - 00:55:08: i was trying to move a grand piano with
00:55:05 - 00:55:10: a crane into my one-story house like
00:55:08 - 00:55:12: it showed the house it was like a ranch
00:55:10 - 00:55:13: you know with a flat roof almost dude
00:55:12 - 00:55:15: you
00:55:13 - 00:55:18: [ __ ] dropped a cinder block just from
00:55:15 - 00:55:22: like five feet above her head like that
00:55:18 - 00:55:23: i guess i could [ __ ] destroy you but
00:55:22 - 00:55:25: if you just hit your toes or something
00:55:23 - 00:55:27: it would really hurt but dude that [ __ ]
00:55:25 - 00:55:29: would it always kill you like it would
00:55:27 - 00:55:31: no i feel like if it smacked you in the
00:55:29 - 00:55:33: head like especially the corner of the
00:55:31 - 00:55:35: butt yeah that would god yeah please
00:55:33 - 00:55:37: an insane head fracture
00:55:35 - 00:55:39: at least maybe blow up your brain make
00:55:37 - 00:55:40: you not such a [ __ ] anymore and he
00:55:39 - 00:55:42: wouldn't have to kill you all right
00:55:40 - 00:55:45: maybe if she would have been better and
00:55:42 - 00:55:46: he wouldn't have had to kill her
00:55:45 - 00:55:48: maybe he was hoping that cinder block
00:55:46 - 00:55:50: would fall and deform her face so she
00:55:48 - 00:55:52: was prettier
00:55:50 - 00:55:55: oh god just rips all the skin off her
00:55:52 - 00:55:57: face no it just moves the skin into more
00:55:55 - 00:55:59: appealing places on the way like it rips
00:55:57 - 00:56:01: all the skin off like when handsome
00:55:59 - 00:56:02: smooth where he hits his face on the
00:56:01 - 00:56:04: door and he's beautiful
00:56:02 - 00:56:06: yeah like i've been watching too much
00:56:04 - 00:56:07: spongebob he could get out of the corner
00:56:06 - 00:56:09: yeah
00:56:07 - 00:56:10: i think they had that on family guy too
00:56:09 - 00:56:12: where he was the bully was beating the
00:56:10 - 00:56:13: [ __ ] out of her and every time they
00:56:12 - 00:56:16: punch her she would look attractive and
00:56:13 - 00:56:19: ugly
00:56:16 - 00:56:22: what's that one [ __ ] vanilla sky or
00:56:19 - 00:56:24: whatever yeah tom cruise movie uh
00:56:22 - 00:56:25: that's the opposite i guess that's
00:56:24 - 00:56:28: getting hit in the face and getting
00:56:25 - 00:56:30: horribly uh disfigured yeah that's
00:56:28 - 00:56:32: actually see i guess the funny part was
00:56:30 - 00:56:33: that someone ugly would get hit in the
00:56:32 - 00:56:34: face
00:56:33 - 00:56:36: which is normally a disfiguring thing
00:56:34 - 00:56:38: and then looking more beautiful and
00:56:36 - 00:56:39: boobs like my contribution to this is
00:56:38 - 00:56:40: going to be a beautiful man that was hit
00:56:39 - 00:56:42: in the face and just turned ugly which
00:56:40 - 00:56:45: is horrible
00:56:42 - 00:56:45: that's the normal
00:56:51 - 00:56:55: i've seen more examples of ugly people
00:56:53 - 00:56:59: turning beautiful woodward and vague on
00:56:55 - 00:56:59: family guy i've only seen one guy
00:57:00 - 00:57:04: humanity this freak accident where his
00:57:02 - 00:57:06: face gets [ __ ] up and he actually
00:57:04 - 00:57:06: looks ugly
00:57:07 - 00:57:12: what a freak accident yeah
00:57:09 - 00:57:16: my face got so slowly burned just like
00:57:12 - 00:57:18: reorganized into a beautiful face
00:57:16 - 00:57:22: cleaned up all my pores all my acne got
00:57:18 - 00:57:22: completely cinched
00:57:24 - 00:57:30: off yeah i like the sky though because
00:57:27 - 00:57:32: that that movie had a great soundtrack
00:57:30 - 00:57:34: everybody acts like it's a piece of [ __ ]
00:57:32 - 00:57:36: compared to the uh something
00:57:34 - 00:57:37: rojos or whatever
00:57:36 - 00:57:39: it was based off of us like a mexican
00:57:37 - 00:57:42: movie there's another one that came out
00:57:39 - 00:57:43: recently that was just then
00:57:42 - 00:57:45: based off both those
00:57:43 - 00:57:48: i don't know by recently i mean probably
00:57:45 - 00:57:48: like five years ago or something
00:57:49 - 00:57:53: so i guess there are a couple examples
00:57:52 - 00:57:55: historically yeah i think there was like
00:57:53 - 00:57:57: a vanilla sky like
00:57:55 - 00:57:59: type exact type movie that came out
00:57:57 - 00:58:02: recently-ish
00:57:59 - 00:58:04: post-vanilla another one i don't oh it's
00:58:02 - 00:58:05: with the i can even kind of think of it

01:05:28 - 01:05:32: question there's like two more questions

01:05:39 - 01:05:43: forgotten all right and that one's a
01:05:41 - 01:05:45: true crestorian question
01:05:43 - 01:05:48: okay all right number three this is my
01:05:45 - 01:05:50: third question okay he won drew himself
01:05:48 - 01:05:53: fingering a girl he knew to control his
01:05:50 - 01:05:53: sexual urges
01:05:53 - 01:05:56: drew himself in a three-way to prove
01:05:55 - 01:05:58: he's straight
01:05:56 - 01:06:01: three managed to trick a girl into
01:05:58 - 01:06:03: sharing a hotel room with him
01:06:01 - 01:06:05: and four has made the news at least
01:06:03 - 01:06:07: twice in his life
01:06:05 - 01:06:09: that's definitely true
01:06:07 - 01:06:09: um
01:06:10 - 01:06:14: i think three again i think it's either
01:06:12 - 01:06:15: two or three i'm gonna go with wait was
01:06:14 - 01:06:17: three again
01:06:15 - 01:06:19: managed to trick a girl into sharing a
01:06:17 - 01:06:21: hotel room with him oh god that does
01:06:19 - 01:06:23: sound like something they'd be able to
01:06:21 - 01:06:24: pull off though uh
01:06:23 - 01:06:26: i'm gonna go with just so we have
01:06:24 - 01:06:27: different answers too
01:06:26 - 01:06:29: wait
01:06:27 - 01:06:31: wait wait wait wait
01:06:29 - 01:06:32: you wouldn't do two is the answer two in
01:06:31 - 01:06:34: a row
01:06:32 - 01:06:36: i don't feel like because
01:06:34 - 01:06:37: or maybe you would maybe you wouldn't
01:06:36 - 01:06:38: expect that
01:06:37 - 01:06:40: okay you know what fine i'd lock it in
01:06:38 - 01:06:42: too
01:06:40 - 01:06:44: okay sam was right he [ __ ]
01:06:42 - 01:06:46: he he tried to trick it was the same
01:06:44 - 01:06:47: girl that he drew he tried to trick her
01:06:46 - 01:06:49: into going to a hotel room and then
01:06:47 - 01:06:52: didn't work it was an attempt okay the
01:06:49 - 01:06:54: first one i chose was a lie because you
01:06:52 - 01:06:56: would not that was a human a human that
01:06:54 - 01:06:59: rose person yeah i was like there's no

01:12:36 - 01:12:40: the odst one oh that was hilarious
01:12:38 - 01:12:42: because like ninety percent of people
01:12:40 - 01:12:45: are like um actually the term spook is
01:12:42 - 01:12:47: referring to spies within the military
01:12:45 - 01:12:50: it's a joke yeah like we
01:12:47 - 01:12:52: were just like joking about like why
01:12:50 - 01:12:54: like why would they say that and like
01:12:52 - 01:12:57: dude like i was just blown away like
01:12:54 - 01:12:59: there's so many comments and it's like
01:12:57 - 01:13:01: don't you see the guy like the four guys
01:12:59 - 01:13:04: below you just said that like how do
01:13:01 - 01:13:05: they think they're contributing anything
01:13:04 - 01:13:07: it's just weird
01:13:05 - 01:13:08: well okay because the people for the
01:13:07 - 01:13:10: record the people that are listening
01:13:08 - 01:13:11: this right now that probably commented
01:13:10 - 01:13:12: that
01:13:11 - 01:13:15: yeah that we i don't think you're weird
01:13:12 - 01:13:16: that we interpreted the term spook as
01:13:15 - 01:13:19: the racist
01:13:16 - 01:13:23: derogatory slur because it was funnier
01:13:19 - 01:13:26: than just being like oh he's a spy
01:13:23 - 01:13:27: yep if we if we took it as the way that
01:13:26 - 01:13:29: you
01:13:27 - 01:13:31: universally see it as there wouldn't be
01:13:29 - 01:13:33: a clip there is not even a joke yeah and
01:13:31 - 01:13:34: we would have just sat there in silence
01:13:33 - 01:13:37: during the cutscene
01:13:34 - 01:13:39: but it wasn't that bad
01:13:37 - 01:13:41: it says the word spook we are going to
01:13:39 - 01:13:43: go for the gutters
01:13:41 - 01:13:44: and we're going to go for the worst joke
01:13:43 - 01:13:46: you can see
01:13:44 - 01:13:48: yes
01:13:46 - 01:13:52: sorry if you wanted to hear a 12-minute
01:13:48 - 01:13:52: riff on uh military spies
01:13:52 - 01:13:57: don't think that word means that
01:13:55 - 01:14:00: i just did some googling and turns out
01:13:57 - 01:14:02: like shut up point next no [ __ ] cares

01:15:01 - 01:15:05: capital and stuff like that all the
01:15:03 - 01:15:07: state work so then there's like the

01:15:29 - 01:15:33: just a [ __ ]
01:15:31 - 01:15:35: void of nothing like it the road is they
01:15:33 - 01:15:37: were like how straight can we make this
01:15:35 - 01:15:40: thing and it's flat as far as i could

01:15:40 - 01:15:45: and pine trees mixed in a big forest
01:15:42 - 01:15:47: and uh up that [ __ ] huge like
01:15:45 - 01:15:50: oh it's probably not the same one but
01:15:47 - 01:15:51: there's like a stretch of like where you
01:15:50 - 01:15:54: when we go to where we go in florida
01:15:51 - 01:15:56: like an hour of driving through woods
