00:00:00 - 00:00:04: Do you honestly think Mr. Owaisi, a non-Muslim voter, looks at you with an open mind?
00:00:04 - 00:00:07: They think that by asking these kind of questions will give them more TRP.
00:00:07 - 00:00:09: Even I know how they'll get that TRP.
00:00:09 - 00:00:10: There is no need to ban you.
00:00:10 - 00:00:12: No no, they fired at me.
00:00:12 - 00:00:14: #dhaaddhaad
00:00:14 - 00:00:16: They fired guns at you? 
-Yes yes, they did.
00:00:16 - 00:00:21: You won't believe, I bought him coffee once, that coward.
00:00:21 - 00:00:23: I want to ask one question, it might be offensive.
00:00:23 - 00:00:24: Have you ever danced?
00:00:24 - 00:00:25: I don't know what it is.
00:00:25 - 00:00:28: Do you also have some hypocrisy or not?
00:00:28 - 00:00:30: Is the Indian government doing something good or is everything going wrong?
00:00:30 - 00:00:35: You have made hatred common, you have told people that this is a community and you are in danger because of them.
00:00:35 - 00:00:36: You are a grandparent?
00:00:36 - 00:00:37: Yes.
00:00:37 - 00:00:39: You have become a grandfather?
00:00:39 - 00:00:40: Why don't you keep a moustache?
00:00:40 - 00:00:45: You start like this, then you lift someone up and the other person lifts up even more.
00:00:45 - 00:00:47: Then you try to bring the person down.
00:00:47 - 00:00:50: He is scared of everything. He was laughing in Bihar like this, #pyaare.
00:00:50 - 00:00:52: In Urdu, it is said that he was in a state of fear.
00:00:52 - 00:00:54: Do you ever see a Muslim being Prime Minister of India?
00:00:54 - 00:00:56: They see you as a godly figure.
00:00:56 - 00:00:57: Have you ever been fined?
00:00:57 - 00:00:59: You are still young, but...
00:00:59 - 00:01:01: We will remain young, God willing.
00:01:01 - 00:01:03: Don't go for the whiteness of our beard.
00:01:03 - 00:01:06: What would be the relationship between religion and state?
00:01:06 - 00:01:08: Apart from the Quran, do you read anything?
00:01:08 - 00:01:11: Did I call you here to ask you this question?
00:01:11 - 00:01:12: Why does the question bother you so much?
00:01:12 - 00:01:16: I am not against it, but the politicians need therapy?
00:01:16 - 00:01:18: 'Hum toh doobe hain sanam, tumko bhi le doobenge.'
00:01:18 - 00:01:18: Haule.
00:01:18 - 00:01:21: What is haule? Haule means? Haule.
00:01:21 - 00:01:22: You are a little adorable.
00:01:22 - 00:01:25: 'Chaliye, chhape hue paaye' (Hyderabadi slang). It is to fool everyone.
00:01:25 - 00:01:27: You are always welcome to come and chill with me.
00:01:27 - 00:01:29: Yeah? Alright!
-Yeah, in all the halal way.
00:01:32 - 00:01:34: I don't know if they will ban that as well.
00:01:37 - 00:01:41: Dude, nowadays, when I tell my team that I am going to do an interview of XYZ
00:01:41 - 00:01:44: So the questions that my team send me are a little better now.
00:01:44 - 00:01:46: Then I asked my team, how did this happen?
00:01:46 - 00:01:49: You guys have gotten better or you guys have started using ChatGPT?
00:01:49 - 00:01:54: Then I found out that with the help of AI and ChatGPT, people are also finding great questions,
00:01:54 - 00:01:57: and my team is fooling me and sending me.
00:01:57 - 00:02:01: Then I thought that my knowledge should also increase about AI and ChatGPT
00:02:01 - 00:02:04: and then I came to know about Growth School.
00:02:04 - 00:02:08: First of all, thank you to Growth School for sponsoring this video.

00:03:11 - 00:03:13: Hyderabad. Where a political super-star,

00:03:16 - 00:03:18: So, today, the entire day, along with
00:03:18 - 00:03:21: the National President of All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen,
00:03:21 - 00:03:24: the MP of Hyderabad, political super-star, Mr. Asaduddin Owaisi,
00:03:25 - 00:03:27: a little sightseeing of his constituency,
00:03:27 - 00:03:29: a little leg-pulling, a little casual talk.

00:04:12 - 00:04:15: Oh... #khatirdari
00:04:15 - 00:04:17: Even KCR sir didn't do this much.
00:04:17 - 00:04:18: KTR sir.
00:04:18 - 00:04:20: Maybe that's why in the election...
00:04:21 - 00:04:22: Sir.
00:04:22 - 00:04:22: How are you?
00:04:22 - 00:04:24: I'm great. How are you?
00:04:25 - 00:04:26: My hands are a little dirty.
00:04:26 - 00:04:27: It's fine, sir.
00:04:27 - 00:04:28: How are you?
00:04:29 - 00:04:30: #aapkanamakkhaaliyahai
00:04:30 - 00:04:32: So I'll have to do a good interview.
00:04:32 - 00:04:32: Absolutely.
00:04:32 - 00:04:33: #aapnamakhalalikariye
00:04:34 - 00:04:35: #namakharamimatkariye
00:04:35 - 00:04:36: Okay.
00:04:36 - 00:04:38: Remember, you'll betray the country.
00:04:38 - 00:04:39: Alright, alright.
00:04:44 - 00:04:45: Is this your helmet?
00:04:45 - 00:04:46: Yes.
00:04:46 - 00:04:50: If I don't wear a helmet, then the "Sanghis" will start saying this and that.
00:04:51 - 00:04:52: That I am not wearing a helmet.
00:04:52 - 00:04:54: Do you watch YouTube generally?
00:04:55 - 00:04:58: A little. Like for 2-4 minutes, when I have  time.
00:04:58 - 00:05:00: But you are doing very well.
00:05:00 - 00:05:02: Thank you. Do you watch your interviews?
00:05:03 - 00:05:04: What is there to watch?
00:05:04 - 00:05:06: I have already said what I have to say. What else can I do?
00:05:06 - 00:05:08: Once the arrow has left the bow,
00:05:08 - 00:05:10: How can I get the arrow back?
00:05:11 - 00:05:14: Has it ever happened that you shot a wrong arrow?
00:05:14 - 00:05:15: Yes, it has happened many times.
00:05:15 - 00:05:16: When did it happen? Give me an example.
00:05:17 - 00:05:18: No, it has happened many times.
00:05:18 - 00:05:21: I am not giving an example, I am a human being.
00:05:21 - 00:05:24: I always try to listen to the whole question.
00:05:24 - 00:05:27: But I get anxious and I don't know what is happening.
00:05:27 - 00:05:32: Sometimes, I think that the question was different and I said something else.
00:05:32 - 00:05:38: Anyway, you make mistakes in everything and you keep correcting yourself.
00:05:38 - 00:05:39: It happens.
00:05:40 - 00:05:42: And nowadays, we have to be very careful.
00:05:42 - 00:05:43: Because once you...
-Why?
00:05:43 - 00:05:45: No, no. Once it goes on YouTube,
00:05:46 - 00:05:48: you can still say in a paper statement that
00:05:48 - 00:05:50: you made a mistake, you lied.
00:05:50 - 00:05:51: I didn't say anything.
00:05:52 - 00:05:55: But when you say it in a video... we've found a solution for that too.
00:05:55 - 00:05:55: What is it?
00:05:55 - 00:05:56: Deepfake.
00:05:58 - 00:06:00: I was thinking the same.
00:06:00 - 00:06:01: We've found a solution for that too.
00:06:02 - 00:06:04: Now the video is live, so I can say that I didn't say it.
00:06:05 - 00:06:06: Now they don't even call it morph, it's deepfake.
00:06:06 - 00:06:07: That's right.
00:06:07 - 00:06:12: But do you think about artificial intelligence as a legislator also?
00:06:12 - 00:06:14: No, but it is very dangerous.
00:06:14 - 00:06:19: Especially when there are criminals,
00:06:19 - 00:06:21: who wants to take revenge from someone,
00:06:21 - 00:06:24: and sadistic people, then it is very dangerous.
00:06:24 - 00:06:28: I mean, the damage is already done by the time you realise, you're done for.
00:06:28 - 00:06:30: Do you work on your voice?
00:06:30 - 00:06:31: No, sir. Not at all.
00:06:32 - 00:06:35: You don't do any practice, any vocal or breathing exercise?
00:06:35 - 00:06:37: Oh, my! What are you trying to do?
00:06:37 - 00:06:40: Are you going to ask me to make an album and sing you a song?
00:06:40 - 00:06:41: What will you say?
00:06:41 - 00:06:43: You know, you have to give speeches, you have to give interviews,
00:06:43 - 00:06:45: you have to be active with your voice.
00:06:45 - 00:06:49: No, no. The golden rule for me is that,
00:06:49 - 00:06:53: I try to stay away from things that give me allergies.
00:06:54 - 00:06:58: And while campaigning, your voice is affected by the dust present there,
00:06:58 - 00:07:00: so, you have to be careful with that.
00:07:00 - 00:07:02: You know, you can spray a little nasal spray.
00:07:03 - 00:07:04: So, you are in that active phase now?
00:07:04 - 00:07:07: The election has just started, so nothing will happen.
00:07:07 - 00:07:09: What are your hopes from this election?
00:07:10 - 00:07:14: For your party and nationally, what is your best case scenario?
00:07:14 - 00:07:16: We are fighting for just three seats.
00:07:16 - 00:07:18: Aurangabad, Hyderabad and?
00:07:18 - 00:07:19: Kishanganj in Bihar.
00:07:19 - 00:07:26: In Uttar Pradesh, we are supporting the PDM, Pallavi Patel.
00:07:26 - 00:07:30: In Tamil Nadu, we are supporting AIDMK, there is no candidate.
00:07:30 - 00:07:36: And in Maharashtra, we have announced a candidate for Pune.
00:07:36 - 00:07:40: Also in Maharashtra, because the assembly elections are in six months,
00:07:40 - 00:07:42: we have to elect our candidates.
00:07:43 - 00:07:45: In Uttar Pradesh, we will have to see.
00:07:46 - 00:07:50: Those who used to abuse us, will abuse us again and still do.
00:07:50 - 00:07:54: I'm are trying to see how much you will win without a Muslim.
00:07:55 - 00:07:57: Tell me. We will see.
00:07:57 - 00:08:00: We will sit and watch. Now, there is going to be a popcorn moment.
00:08:00 - 00:08:02: Oh, you will enjoy it.
00:08:02 - 00:08:06: No, I am not enjoying it. These people talk so much.
00:08:06 - 00:08:09: For example, the seat of Muradabad's parliament.
00:08:09 - 00:08:13: I am telling you that the MPs in our Indian parliament,
00:08:14 - 00:08:20: the MP of Muradabad, Dr. S.T. Hasan, is a very decent person.
00:08:21 - 00:08:24: We told him in the last session of parliament that
00:08:24 - 00:08:26: "Doctor Sahab, you are not going to get the ticket."
00:08:26 - 00:08:28: You're talking about SP?
00:08:28 - 00:08:29: Yes, Samajwadi Party.
00:08:29 - 00:08:32: They didn't announce your name and I'm telling you that you won't get the ticket.
00:08:32 - 00:08:33: He said, what are you saying, Asad Bhai?
00:08:34 - 00:08:35: But why do you think this was done to him?
00:08:35 - 00:08:40: This was done because they didn't want any leadership to develop in the party.
00:08:40 - 00:08:43: You're talking about the state, because he is a Muslim.
00:08:43 - 00:08:44: Absolutely.
00:08:44 - 00:08:45: This is the reason?
00:08:45 - 00:08:47: This is the reason. See for yourself.
00:08:47 - 00:08:48: There was no reason.
00:08:48 - 00:08:50: His performance was very good in the parliament.
00:08:50 - 00:08:52: He's a sitting MP.
00:08:52 - 00:08:52: Sitting MP.
00:08:53 - 00:08:53: He was the mayor of Muradabad.
00:08:53 - 00:08:54: So he can win.
00:08:54 - 00:08:57: Of course, he would have won today, but they didn't give it to him.
00:08:57 - 00:09:03: If S. T. Hasan wins the second time, he will become a stronger leader.
00:09:03 - 00:09:07: So, my question remains, what is your best case scenario for this election?
00:09:07 - 00:09:13: The problem with minorities is that we don't have a choice.
00:09:13 - 00:09:19: Either we will be poisoned with slow poison, which will lead to physical death,
00:09:19 - 00:09:24: or we will be poisoned with the kind slow poison which will lead to us not being in the elections.
00:09:24 - 00:09:31: On one hand, Modi has made us Muslims invisible,
00:09:31 - 00:09:32: they are doing the same.
00:09:32 - 00:09:34: And what does the community need to do then?
00:09:34 - 00:09:39: The community should realise,
00:09:39 - 00:09:41: they should put a full stop,
00:09:41 - 00:09:44: that we have voted for these people.
00:09:44 - 00:09:45: That this won't work, that won't work.
00:09:45 - 00:09:49: No, no, they have voted, so they are not able to stop the BJP, number one.
00:09:49 - 00:09:53: Second, they are not allowing your leadership to develop.
00:09:53 - 00:09:58: Thirdly, you don't talk about us. You are afraid to talk about us.
00:09:58 - 00:10:00: You are afraid to use the word "Muslim".
00:10:00 - 00:10:03: Okay, get today's newspaper.
00:10:03 - 00:10:05: What will the community have to do?
00:10:05 - 00:10:12: We are telling the community to start acquiring the votes.
00:10:12 - 00:10:14: You are voting, you are giving out lots of ballots,
00:10:14 - 00:10:15: but nothing is happening.
00:10:16 - 00:10:17: The alternative is to become...
00:10:17 - 00:10:20: Yes, the alternative is to start acquiring the votes.
00:10:20 - 00:10:25: You will lose, you will not win, but you will become a politician.
00:10:25 - 00:10:26: And that will be your strength.
00:10:26 - 00:10:33: People will see that XYZ candidate has taken this many votes,
00:10:33 - 00:10:34: so you will get votes.
00:10:34 - 00:10:36: Only then will these people improve.
00:10:36 - 00:10:37: It is important to become a candidate.
00:10:37 - 00:10:39: Become a candidate, fight the elections.
00:10:39 - 00:10:42: Now, every election that comes,
00:10:42 - 00:10:46: it is a matter of life and death for Muslims.
00:10:46 - 00:10:47: You said this last time as well.
00:10:47 - 00:10:48: Yes.
00:10:48 - 00:10:49: You said exactly this.
00:10:49 - 00:10:51: It is still happening.
00:10:51 - 00:10:52: It's on your birthday, right?
00:10:52 - 00:10:53: Now...
00:10:53 - 00:10:55: How do you celebrate your birthday?
00:10:55 - 00:10:58: I have never celebrated my birthday, nor am I a fan of it.
00:10:58 - 00:11:01: I don't understand why, you are getting closer to death every year.
00:11:01 - 00:11:03: You should celebrate something.
00:11:03 - 00:11:06: You are getting closer to death every year.
00:11:06 - 00:11:08: And you are celebrating.
00:11:08 - 00:11:13: I think you are going to die. You are 54 or 55.
00:11:13 - 00:11:14: So, are you sad on your birthday?
-What?
00:11:14 - 00:11:16: Do you cry on your birthday?
00:11:16 - 00:11:23: No, no, I don't cry, I don't laugh, but I try to thank the Almighty,
00:11:23 - 00:11:26: what we call in Urdu/ Arabic, "Nehmat".
00:11:26 - 00:11:30: That gift or whatever thing is given, that is most important.
00:11:30 - 00:11:31: What's it called? Nehmat?
00:11:31 - 00:11:31: Nehmat, yes.
00:11:31 - 00:11:33: What does it mean?
00:11:33 - 00:11:41: It means that Allah has given you food, a place to live, health.
00:11:41 - 00:11:43: This is a great blessing from Allah.
00:11:43 - 00:11:47: For example, you have become popular because of your hard work. It is a blessing from God.
00:11:47 - 00:11:50: Who is messaging you?
-Nobody.
00:11:50 - 00:11:52: It keeps going on. It keeps getting alerts.
00:11:54 - 00:11:56: Thank you, sir. You take it.
00:11:57 - 00:11:58: You take it. Mine is coming.
00:11:58 - 00:11:59: He'll not that the sugar one.
00:11:59 - 00:12:02: No, no sugar for me. Thank you.
00:12:02 - 00:12:02: Is it okay?
00:12:02 - 00:12:03: It is very good.
00:12:03 - 00:12:05: Very good. You like it.
00:12:05 - 00:12:07: I will not complain.
00:12:09 - 00:12:14: I wanted to ask you about Bihar. I was seeing a little worryness on your face.
00:12:14 - 00:12:15: Where?
00:12:15 - 00:12:16: In the interview in Bihar.
00:12:16 - 00:12:18: With Prashant or Tej?
00:12:19 - 00:12:21: No, no, I won't say that on-record. This is being recorded.
00:12:21 - 00:12:22: I understood.
00:12:22 - 00:12:23: I will talk about this off-the-record.
00:12:23 - 00:12:24: No, no, say it on-record.
00:12:24 - 00:12:25: No, not on-record.
00:12:25 - 00:12:26: It will go viral.
00:12:26 - 00:12:28: I was watching something and I saw that.
00:12:28 - 00:12:31: I was like okay! I will see this first,
00:12:31 - 00:12:32: bring it quickly and I saw it.
00:12:32 - 00:12:34: You were a little...
00:12:35 - 00:12:38: In Urdu, it is said that he was in a state of fear.
#Tazbazabkeaalammethe
00:12:38 - 00:12:41: What is the weirdest thing you have heard about yourself?
00:12:41 - 00:12:43: The weirdest thing is...
00:12:44 - 00:12:46: I would've told you if there are only one or two, it is weird every day.
00:12:46 - 00:12:49: Still, the weirdest thing is that it is the opposite of your personality.
00:12:49 - 00:12:54: Well, being a politician, you are a target.
00:12:54 - 00:12:54: Okay.
00:12:54 - 00:12:58: You cannot stop anyone from speaking or accusing someone.
00:12:58 - 00:13:01: Still, tell me an instance. I am not saying to stop.
00:13:01 - 00:13:03: There are many journalists who don't know me.
00:13:03 - 00:13:05: They say that I am a fundamentalist.
00:13:05 - 00:13:12: When we meet and talk, they think that 'Oh he is not so bad.'
00:13:12 - 00:13:12: Okay.
00:13:12 - 00:13:14: He is a little less bad.
00:13:14 - 00:13:18: I say that I'm not a little bad, I have a lot of bad qualities,
00:13:18 - 00:13:20: but I'm acting in front of you.
00:13:21 - 00:13:22: That is also possible.
00:13:22 - 00:13:24: That is also possible.
00:13:24 - 00:13:25: That is a part of your profession.
00:13:25 - 00:13:26: Yes.
00:13:26 - 00:13:28: But you have to act often, no?
00:13:28 - 00:13:29: No, no.
00:13:29 - 00:13:33: You see, the Prime Minister of India is the only one who performs.
00:13:33 - 00:13:34: No one else can do it.
00:13:35 - 00:13:38: But you are in the same profession and you are a super-star of that profession.
00:13:38 - 00:13:38: No, no, no.
00:13:38 - 00:13:40: The day he...
00:13:40 - 00:13:44: I am saying that he should act in his biopic, it will become a hit.
00:13:45 - 00:13:45: It will become a hit.
00:13:45 - 00:13:47: Someone else has made it, and it was a flop.
00:13:47 - 00:13:51: If he had made it himself, he would have produced it himself.
00:13:51 - 00:13:57: He will do everything and it is possible that he will be awarded an Oscar.
00:13:57 - 00:14:00: So you don't have to perform. Come on.
00:14:00 - 00:14:01: No, no, no.
00:14:01 - 00:14:02: Talk with honesty.
00:14:02 - 00:14:04: No, no, I am saying with honesty. What will I perform?
00:14:04 - 00:14:08: You know when you have to give a speech, when you have to show your anger,
00:14:08 - 00:14:10: or even in Parliament.
00:14:10 - 00:14:16: I believe that the speech that you believe in,
00:14:16 - 00:14:20: is the best speech and it reaches to the people well.
00:14:20 - 00:14:23: But doesn't it happen that you don't believe in it,
00:14:24 - 00:14:25: that day you are not feeling well,
00:14:26 - 00:14:30: or you are not feeling the emotion, and then you have to act it out?
00:14:30 - 00:14:35: No, no, no, not like that. The problem I have is that,
00:14:35 - 00:14:40: you have to believe that the most difficult thing for me is giving a speech.
00:14:40 - 00:14:41: I am saying the truth.
00:14:41 - 00:14:43: This is a little impossible to believe, but why are you saying this?
00:14:43 - 00:14:45: No, no, I am telling you the truth. It is not an easy thing.
00:14:45 - 00:14:49: Some people have a gift.
00:14:49 - 00:14:52: Now, if you ask me to give a speech at 2 in 10 minutes,
00:14:52 - 00:14:57: I will ask you about the topic and what to say in these speeches.
00:14:57 - 00:14:59: And that it will take an hour or two to give a speech not 10 minutes.
00:14:59 - 00:15:02: Some people have a gift.
00:15:02 - 00:15:02: "Baaz"?
00:15:02 - 00:15:07: Yes, 'baaz log', I mean, few people.
00:15:07 - 00:15:14: And nowadays, if you sneeze and you sneeze loudly,
00:15:14 - 00:15:17: then anyone can file a case of hurting sentiment.
00:15:17 - 00:15:18: Okay.
00:15:18 - 00:15:19: Speech is a distant thing
00:15:21 - 00:15:24: So, sometimes you sneeze out of laughter.
00:15:24 - 00:15:27: A day will come, in our country,
00:15:27 - 00:15:30: that you should not even laugh loudly.
00:15:31 - 00:15:32: You should only smile.
00:15:32 - 00:15:33: I will be banned on that day.
00:15:33 - 00:15:34: Yes, only smile.
00:15:34 - 00:15:36: Like you have laughed just now.
-Yes yes.
00:15:36 - 00:15:37: You are still laughing.
00:15:38 - 00:15:39: You are laughing so loudly.
00:15:39 - 00:15:39: This should not be allowed.
00:15:40 - 00:15:41: They will say, this is at the decibel level.
00:15:41 - 00:15:43: This is becoming like the 'Azan'.
00:15:43 - 00:15:45: Reduce it.
00:15:46 - 00:15:51: Look, everything will have a decibel level.
00:15:51 - 00:15:53: If it is compared to the Azan, then we'll be done for.
-No no.
00:15:53 - 00:15:56: This will cause pollution.
00:15:56 - 00:15:58: It will cause pollution of laughter.
00:15:58 - 00:16:00: We are on our way to it, not yet.
00:16:00 - 00:16:01: Okay.
00:16:01 - 00:16:02: You are laughing now.
00:16:02 - 00:16:04: When it is done, you can call us.
00:16:04 - 00:16:06: I will cry, I will cry loudly.
00:16:06 - 00:16:08: You will be banned from crying.
00:16:08 - 00:16:10: Work with courage. Why are you crying?
00:16:10 - 00:16:12: We are Vishwa Guru. How will you cry?
00:16:12 - 00:16:15: But realistically you think this? This is an exaggerated truth?
00:16:15 - 00:16:17: No, no. I can see it.
00:16:17 - 00:16:20: In Urdu, it is called writing on the wall.
00:16:20 - 00:16:21: 'Navishta-e-deewar'
00:16:21 - 00:16:25: Yes, why are you crying so much? We are Vishwa Guru.
00:16:25 - 00:16:28: You shouldn't cry. Control your emotions.
00:16:28 - 00:16:30: How much screen time do you have on your phone?
00:16:30 - 00:16:32: Do you use Instagram?
00:16:32 - 00:16:34: No, no. It's not my department.
00:16:34 - 00:16:35: It's someone else's, a youngster, they manage it.
00:16:35 - 00:16:37: Do you have Instagram on your phone?
00:16:37 - 00:16:40: No, I do, but the other team looks after it.
00:16:40 - 00:16:43: No, no. The posting is fine, but do you watch Reels?
00:16:43 - 00:16:44: No, no, no.
00:16:44 - 00:16:45: Come on, seriously.
00:16:45 - 00:16:47: I'm telling the truth. Why would I lie to you?
00:16:47 - 00:16:48: You must have been addicted to it at one point.
00:16:48 - 00:16:49: No, no. Not at all.
00:16:49 - 00:16:50: Two years ago?
00:16:50 - 00:16:54: No, no. I'm a 'thumbs up' in these things.
00:16:55 - 00:16:57: 'Thumbs up'?
00:16:57 - 00:16:59: I'm going to learn so many terminology today.
00:17:00 - 00:17:01: 'Navishta-e-deewar'.
00:17:01 - 00:17:02: 'Navishta-e-deewar', writing on the wall.
00:17:02 - 00:17:05: 'Baaz', 'Navishta-e-deewar', 'thumbs up'.
00:17:05 - 00:17:06: Is thumbs up also Urdu?
00:17:06 - 00:17:09: No, thumbs up is a slang word.
00:17:09 - 00:17:10: I understood.
00:17:10 - 00:17:12: We'll talk about Bihar.
00:17:15 - 00:17:17: What do you want to know?
00:17:17 - 00:17:18: Say it on the camera.
00:17:18 - 00:17:27: Samdish was not understanding what is happening, he was laughing at himself and was like let's wrap this up quickly.
00:17:27 - 00:17:28: I saw it in 4-5 minutes.
00:17:28 - 00:17:31: You know, we will release two more videos.
00:17:31 - 00:17:33: I said, okay, okay.
00:17:33 - 00:17:37: For the first time, you looked worried.
00:17:37 - 00:17:39: No, I was worried with you for the first time.
00:17:39 - 00:17:42: No, what was with me? I took you to have breakfast.
00:17:42 - 00:17:43: I made you eat 'bheja'.
00:17:43 - 00:17:44: It was very good.
00:17:44 - 00:17:48: Yes, the liver, kidneys, everything that is part of the body,
00:17:48 - 00:17:50: I have fed you.
00:17:50 - 00:17:52: What was there to be afraid of?
00:17:55 - 00:17:57: Show the guarantee of Modi.
00:17:57 - 00:17:58: Okay.
00:17:58 - 00:18:02: Priority to the deprived.
00:18:02 - 00:18:06: Expansion of PM SVANidhi and Vishwakarma scheme
00:18:06 - 00:18:10: for expanding employment opportunities for OBC, ST and ST communities.
00:18:10 - 00:18:13: Brother, the word 'minority' is in the constitution.
00:18:13 - 00:18:15: Why don't they write the word 'minority'?
00:18:15 - 00:18:16: Here it is written,
00:18:16 - 00:18:20: ensuring scholarship for talented students for marginalised sections.
00:18:20 - 00:18:22: You are talking about scholarship.
00:18:22 - 00:18:24: The pre-matric scholarship of minorities,
00:18:24 - 00:18:26: that was done from class 9.
00:18:26 - 00:18:28: And all the data of Muslims,
00:18:28 - 00:18:30: not my data, the Government's data,
00:18:30 - 00:18:34: that the highest dropout rate is of Muslims after Dalits.
00:18:34 - 00:18:36: And why is it so? There is no financial variable.
00:18:36 - 00:18:38: So where is the dropout? It is from class 4.
00:18:38 - 00:18:40: You are giving scholarship from class 9.
00:18:40 - 00:18:44: But isn't it their loss if such a large community of their own country…
00:18:44 - 00:18:46: They don't think about it, they don't think about it.
00:18:46 - 00:18:48: Isn't it their loss?
00:18:48 - 00:18:50: No, that's an ideology…
00:18:50 - 00:18:52: I'm guessing, and correct me if I'm wrong,
00:18:53 - 00:18:56: the uneducated can be more attracted to radicalisation.
00:18:56 - 00:18:58: Don't they see this?
00:18:58 - 00:19:01: We have already been radicalised in their eyes.
00:19:02 - 00:19:06: And we are being told not to wear a hijab to de-radicalise us.
00:19:06 - 00:19:10: We are being told not to be too religious.
00:19:10 - 00:19:15: We have become radicalised in the eyes of the BJP and RSS.
00:19:15 - 00:19:26: So, we are being told to leave our whole religiosity and follow us and you'll become good in order to come in the mainstream.
00:19:26 - 00:19:29: When you meet the central leader of the BJP, do you talk about this?
00:19:29 - 00:19:31: What is the meaning of meeting him?
00:19:31 - 00:19:34: I mean, in Parliament, you show your element to them.
00:19:34 - 00:19:36: No, there is no question of meeting him.
00:19:36 - 00:19:39: When we speak in Parliament, we repeat the same things.
00:19:39 - 00:19:42: But off-camera, off-record, you don't talk?
00:19:42 - 00:19:45: What will I say? What will I say to them?
00:19:45 - 00:19:48: They are so radicalised that they are not ready to listen.
00:19:48 - 00:19:49: They must have softer elements too.
00:19:50 - 00:19:56: I don't have a thermometer to see how much better or evil someone is.
00:19:56 - 00:19:58: When you have an ideology...
00:19:58 - 00:20:01: Come on, you are taking...
00:20:01 - 00:20:04: I am not saying anything bad about anyone,
00:20:04 - 00:20:05: but you are working under an ideology.
00:20:06 - 00:20:07: But it's slightly convenient.
00:20:07 - 00:20:11: You know who is radicalized and who is not.
00:20:11 - 00:20:16: My job is to stand in the parliament and speak on record.
00:20:16 - 00:20:21: Why should I go and speak in a private house?
00:20:21 - 00:20:22: But if that works.
00:20:22 - 00:20:25: Where does it work? Tell me.
00:20:25 - 00:20:30: Are there non-government actors which you can then use to...
00:20:30 - 00:20:33: I mean, you want education to increase in the community, right?
00:20:33 - 00:20:36: No, look, there is education in the community.
00:20:36 - 00:20:42: I am telling you that the people who hate Muslims and say that Muslims don't want to study,
00:20:42 - 00:20:43: they are the biggest liars.
00:20:43 - 00:20:47: What parents would not want to educate their children?
00:20:47 - 00:20:49: Correct, but they have more reports.
00:20:49 - 00:20:52: You tell me, the report of the Sachar committee has said that
00:20:52 - 00:20:56: 3-4% of Muslim children are in Madrasa.
00:20:56 - 00:20:59: And they quote it. But what is written after that?
00:20:59 - 00:21:03: They are going to Madrasa because there is no school around them.
00:21:03 - 00:21:04: Open a school.
00:21:04 - 00:21:09: In Telangana, after speaking to the Government, TRS, have opened a residential school
00:21:09 - 00:21:11: from Class 6 to Class 12.
00:21:11 - 00:21:18: You will be happy to know that more than 70,000 Muslim children are studying for free.
00:21:18 - 00:21:21: Many years ago, when this school was started,
00:21:21 - 00:21:25: we had to hold a big meeting and tell people to come and take admission in the school.
00:21:25 - 00:21:28: Now, for admission in the school, there is an entrance exam.
00:21:28 - 00:21:31: So, give them an opportunity. Create it.
00:21:31 - 00:21:32: You don't do it.
00:21:32 - 00:21:35: There are only two centres of the minority universities left.
00:21:35 - 00:21:37: You are telling them to end the minority status.
00:21:37 - 00:21:43: The question is, if the population of India is 14% or 17-20 crore,
00:21:43 - 00:21:46: if their children don't study, then what kind of a Vishwa Guru will we be?
00:21:46 - 00:21:50: Do you often meet the Minority Affairs Minister and talk about this?
00:21:50 - 00:21:51: We keep meeting.
00:21:51 - 00:21:55: If you say it, then our friends, the secular people,
00:21:55 - 00:21:57: will do a cut and paste job and say,
00:21:57 - 00:22:01: They show that I've said that we meet them. I have admitted their crime.
00:22:01 - 00:22:02: Now, they will go on the BTM.
00:22:02 - 00:22:04: Is it a crime to meet them?
00:22:04 - 00:22:11: In one meeting, Smriti Rani, the textile minister,
00:22:11 - 00:22:14: called a meeting about power looms.
00:22:14 - 00:22:19: We took photos of our secular people from the meeting.
00:22:19 - 00:22:20: Look, they are together.
00:22:21 - 00:22:23: If we don't go to the meeting of the power loom industry,
00:22:23 - 00:22:24: then who will go?
00:22:24 - 00:22:26: You don't watch TV, right?
00:22:26 - 00:22:27: Why won't I watch TV?
00:22:27 - 00:22:28: Sometimes I do.
00:22:28 - 00:22:29: What do you watch?
00:22:29 - 00:22:30: The World Cup is happening.
00:22:30 - 00:22:31: Cricket match.
00:22:31 - 00:22:32: Sometimes I watch it.
00:22:32 - 00:22:33: Do you watch IPL?
00:22:33 - 00:22:34: No, no, no.
00:22:34 - 00:22:35: Why?
00:22:35 - 00:22:36: What's wrong with it?
00:22:36 - 00:22:36: No, no.
00:22:36 - 00:22:39: I don't...
00:22:39 - 00:22:40: Do you have a favourite commentator?
00:22:40 - 00:22:42: When we were kids,
00:22:42 - 00:22:43: we are still kids.
00:22:43 - 00:22:44: Yes, yes.
00:22:44 - 00:22:46: We used to listen to good commentators.
00:22:46 - 00:22:48: There was a commentator called Narottam Puri.
00:22:48 - 00:22:49: I don't know if he's still around.
00:22:49 - 00:22:50: And there was a commentator called Henry Blofeld.
00:22:50 - 00:22:53: And Michael Holding.
00:22:53 - 00:22:55: He was a great bowler and a great commentator.
00:22:55 - 00:22:57: Do you know what a Bigg Boss is?
00:22:57 - 00:22:58: Yes, I do.
00:22:58 - 00:23:01: What is Bigg Boss in your words?
00:23:01 - 00:23:04: I have read in the newspaper that
00:23:04 - 00:23:07: they take some people to an unknown place,
00:23:07 - 00:23:11: they lock them up in a cave.
00:23:12 - 00:23:16: Let's go for sight-seeing in your constituency now.
Please come, you can sit on my Triumph.
00:23:23 - 00:23:26: This is my childhood dream coming true.
00:23:26 - 00:23:28: I have become like this.
00:23:37 - 00:23:39: Have you ever been fined?
00:23:39 - 00:23:40: Yes, a lot.
00:23:40 - 00:23:41: As MP?
00:23:41 - 00:23:42: Yes, a lot.
00:23:42 - 00:23:46: These days, they don't fine you, they just take a photo and upload it.
00:23:46 - 00:23:47: Yes.
00:23:55 - 00:23:57: You don't need to listen to Kartik.
00:23:57 - 00:23:59: If he is irritating you, let me know.
00:23:59 - 00:23:59: No, no, no.
00:23:59 - 00:24:01: He is just doing his job.
00:24:01 - 00:24:01: Okay.
00:24:08 - 00:24:10: We are going inside your constituency?
00:24:10 - 00:24:14: We haven't entered our constituency yet.
00:24:14 - 00:24:19: This is the Chevella Parliament constituency.
00:24:19 - 00:24:24: This was part of our constituency until 2009.
00:24:24 - 00:24:28: After the delimitation in 2009...
00:24:28 - 00:24:33: ...this has become part of the Chevella Parliament constituency.
00:24:37 - 00:24:39: The Prashant Kishore episode was also good.
-Sorry?
00:24:39 - 00:24:41: The Prashant Kishore episode was also good.
00:24:41 - 00:24:45: Yes, it was very good. They gave us a lot of time so he opened up a lot.
00:24:45 - 00:24:47: What is your opinion about him?
00:24:47 - 00:24:49: Whatever efforts Prashant is putting...
00:24:49 - 00:24:52: I didn't know how much he'll last.
00:24:52 - 00:24:53: Okay.
00:24:54 - 00:24:58: That was... It was a non-trivial thing that
00:24:58 - 00:25:01: A man who used to help to fight elections
00:25:01 - 00:25:03: and with the whole team.
00:25:03 - 00:25:06: In a very professional way. They obviously don't do it for free.
00:25:06 - 00:25:10: I thought they would finish it in 3-4 months.
00:25:10 - 00:25:12: But they are still doing it.
00:25:12 - 00:25:14: It's a highly organised Yatra.
00:25:14 - 00:25:16: I was shocked to see it.
00:25:16 - 00:25:19: People say they organise it very well.
00:25:19 - 00:25:24: They have an optics and do the whole survey.
00:25:24 - 00:25:27: They have a team and a background.
00:25:27 - 00:25:31: But now, he is wearing a different hat of a politician,
00:25:31 - 00:25:34: he doesn't say that he has become a politician.
00:25:34 - 00:25:36: He plays a little conveniently.
-Yes.
00:25:43 - 00:25:45: Keep the keys. Remove the bike.
00:25:45 - 00:25:46: Come.
00:25:51 - 00:25:52: Yes, yes, I am speaking.
00:25:52 - 00:25:54: As-salamu alaykum
00:25:54 - 00:25:59: I, Asaduddin Owaisi, am here to request you to strengthen your party,
00:25:59 - 00:26:03: to strengthen your leadership, and to strengthen your unity.
00:26:30 - 00:26:33: Do you ever think about retirement?
00:26:33 - 00:26:34: Not now.
00:26:34 - 00:26:36: You are still young.
00:26:36 - 00:26:38: I will remain young.
00:26:38 - 00:26:40: Don't judge me by the whiteness of my beard.
00:26:40 - 00:26:41: Okay.
00:26:42 - 00:26:43: I don't know.
00:26:43 - 00:26:46: It's a difficult question to answer.
00:26:47 - 00:26:48: Let us see what happens.
00:26:48 - 00:26:50: I don't know what destiny has in store for me.
00:26:50 - 00:26:57: -Okay. 
But yes, the important thing for me is that we have to keep on creating the
00:26:57 - 00:27:03: second line, third line of leadership within the party, that we are trying. 
-I think someone
00:27:03 - 00:27:10: important is calling. 
-Yeah, it keeps buzzing. 
-He called you in his interview. If you remember.
00:27:10 - 00:27:17: He keeps calling me. You can take it on loudspeaker. You can tell him you are sitting with me.
00:27:17 - 00:27:19: But what happened in the Telangana election?
00:27:20 - 00:27:22: They were very confident.
00:27:22 - 00:27:23: Yes, but...
00:27:23 - 00:27:25: What happened?
00:27:25 - 00:27:30: What happened is, obviously, they know better than me,
00:27:30 - 00:27:33: they will do their post-mortem, they will see what the reasons are.
00:27:33 - 00:27:39: So, now the public has answered, and we'll have to accept the verdict.
00:27:39 - 00:27:43: We tried our best, but now when the result is out,
00:27:43 - 00:27:48: So we'll have to respect it and whoever it is, they'll have to work hard.
00:27:48 - 00:27:54: But what changes in BRS losing power and Congress coming to power in Telangana?
00:27:54 - 00:27:57: I mean the Chief Minister is friendly with you right now, if I'm not wrong.
00:27:57 - 00:27:59: The news that comes to Delhi is like this.
00:27:59 - 00:28:05: It's okay. We have to work for development in our constituency.
00:28:05 - 00:28:11: Like, I didn't get a one metro line in my constituency.
00:28:11 - 00:28:12: Okay.
00:28:12 - 00:28:17: So, when I met the CM, he said, of course we will do it.
00:28:17 - 00:28:19: I told him to come and set up a foundation.
00:28:19 - 00:28:24: He set up the foundation and now the line for the work will be set up.
00:28:24 - 00:28:30: About 1500 crore will be used for just the land acquisition.
00:28:30 - 00:28:32: We have to get the work done.
00:28:32 - 00:28:36: We have opposed the Chief Minister.
00:28:36 - 00:28:38: Now, the result has come.
00:28:38 - 00:28:43: So, we will have to accept it with respect and keep on working.
00:28:43 - 00:28:45: On that note, let's go inside.
00:28:45 - 00:28:47: Come, come.
00:29:03 - 00:29:05: Are you on the right or left?
00:29:05 - 00:29:06: I can go anywhere.
00:29:06 - 00:29:09: But where do you come? Right or left?
00:29:09 - 00:29:11: No, I sit where there is convenience.
00:29:11 - 00:29:14: Oh okay, where there is convenience.
00:29:14 - 00:29:17: What is the coolest slang in Hyderabad? Teach me something.
00:29:17 - 00:29:17: Haule.
00:29:17 - 00:29:20: What is Haule? Haule means? Haule?
00:29:20 - 00:29:25: Haule means, what do you call it? Dumb, dimwit.
00:29:25 - 00:29:26: Okay, Haule.
00:29:26 - 00:29:27: Hey, Haule, shut up.
00:29:27 - 00:29:29: Oh, you called me Haule?
00:29:29 - 00:29:31: No, no, I didn't. I taught you.
00:29:31 - 00:29:32: What are you doing, Asad bhai?
00:29:32 - 00:29:35: Hyderabad has a...
00:29:35 - 00:29:36: Fascinating slang.
00:29:36 - 00:29:37: Yes.
00:29:37 - 00:29:38: The city is also very fascinating.
00:29:38 - 00:29:40: Now who will you call a fool?
00:29:40 - 00:29:41: Next time if someone calls you that,
00:29:41 - 00:29:43: you understand what he is saying.
00:29:43 - 00:29:44: Many people call me a fool.
00:29:44 - 00:29:45: Yes, they call you a fool?
00:29:45 - 00:29:45: Yes, a fool.
00:29:45 - 00:29:47: So many people have called me that in the city today.
00:29:47 - 00:29:49: Which question is the most irritating?
00:29:49 - 00:29:50: Nothing is irritating.
00:29:50 - 00:29:52: Which allegation is the most irritating?
00:29:52 - 00:29:53: Nothing is irritating.
00:29:53 - 00:29:55: Are you not angry that every time
00:29:55 - 00:29:56: you have to prove your Indian-ness?
00:29:56 - 00:29:57: No, no.
00:29:57 - 00:30:00: Now, when I start with my eyes closed,
00:30:00 - 00:30:02: I get angry that what is this poor guy going to ask?
00:30:02 - 00:30:04: Or what is this lady going to ask?
00:30:04 - 00:30:08: Now they think that by asking like this, TRP will come.
00:30:08 - 00:30:12: So we also know how TRP comes.
00:30:12 - 00:30:14: So we give our answer.
00:30:14 - 00:30:16: We call it tantanatan.
00:30:16 - 00:30:18: Tantanatan.
00:30:18 - 00:30:20: When the anchor is in front.
00:30:20 - 00:30:23: Now we will not say, you are saying it.
00:30:23 - 00:30:25: What is your favorite thing about Hyderabad?
00:30:25 - 00:30:27: I love Hyderabad. I am also the MP here.
00:30:27 - 00:30:29: Really? Are you the MP?
00:30:29 - 00:30:30: Yes.
00:30:30 - 00:30:33: Okay, I didn't know. When did this happen?
00:30:33 - 00:30:35: It's been going on since 2004.
00:30:35 - 00:30:37: Really? How has that been?
00:30:37 - 00:30:39: It's been good. It's a challenge.
00:30:39 - 00:30:41: It's going on. We are fighting it again.
00:30:41 - 00:30:43: Okay.
00:30:43 - 00:30:45: We hope that we will be successful again.
00:30:45 - 00:30:47: What do you have to say about the BJP candidates?
00:30:47 - 00:30:49: Lots of noise.
00:30:49 - 00:30:51: It's okay. It's a competition with the party.
00:30:51 - 00:30:53: It's a competition with ideology.
00:30:53 - 00:30:55: And it's a competition with Modi.
00:30:55 - 00:30:57: Do you honestly think Mr. OSI, a non-Muslim voter
00:30:57 - 00:30:59: looks at you with an open mind?
00:30:59 - 00:31:01: Or do they look at you with this prism?
00:31:01 - 00:31:08: There are many non-Muslim people who vote for me.
00:31:08 - 00:31:11: Are they in the number that you would like?
00:31:11 - 00:31:14: Or is it not that much acceptance?
00:31:14 - 00:31:17: No, no. You cannot say that you don't get their votes.
00:31:17 - 00:31:20: Okay. I am asking, do you get as much as you want?
00:31:20 - 00:31:23: I have so many desires that I can die for every desire.
00:31:23 - 00:31:24: You have a lot of desires.
00:31:24 - 00:31:24: I have a few.
00:31:24 - 00:31:26: We have even closed the juggles.
00:31:26 - 00:31:28: You are a genius.
00:31:28 - 00:31:30: Do you listen to music?
00:31:30 - 00:31:32: Do you listen to music?
00:31:32 - 00:31:34: No, not now.
00:31:34 - 00:31:36: You listen to something.
00:31:36 - 00:31:38: Do you consume art?
00:31:38 - 00:31:40: Your art is different, mine is different.
00:31:40 - 00:31:42: Do you dance at weddings?
00:31:42 - 00:31:44: Why?
00:31:44 - 00:31:46: Why dance?
00:31:46 - 00:31:48: No, I have never danced.
00:31:48 - 00:31:50: You are flummoxed.
00:31:50 - 00:31:52: Not flummoxed, but why should I dance?
00:31:52 - 00:31:54: Why does the question bother you so much?
00:31:54 - 00:31:56: No, because...
00:31:56 - 00:31:58: Why can't you dance? I am sure your constituency will be elated if you dance with them.
00:31:58 - 00:32:02: if you dance with them? No, I dance to their tunes in a different way.
00:32:02 - 00:32:07: They see you as a godly figure. No, no, no. Don't you see that? No, no, no. Please, please, please don't go on that.
00:32:07 - 00:32:12: See, I dance to their tunes. Saab, yeh kaam hona hai. Kaam karo. Kaam karte hain.
00:32:12 - 00:32:17: Haan, you, aapne bahut achcha bola. You turned it very well. You danced with my question.
00:32:17 - 00:32:22: No, no, dance toh sahi hai na. But they do see you as such. You know, you look more
00:32:22 - 00:32:27: sophisticated than them. You dress better than them. You are a well-respected figure
00:32:27 - 00:32:29: I am not a respected figure.
00:32:29 - 00:32:31: You are nothing.
00:32:31 - 00:32:33: You are more than that.
00:32:33 - 00:32:35: What I saw visually,
00:32:35 - 00:32:37: people were giving you a lot of love,
00:32:37 - 00:32:40: but what I saw visually, I am asking you.
00:32:41 - 00:32:42: And I am genuinely asking you.
00:32:42 - 00:32:46: Look, the work I am doing for myself,
00:32:46 - 00:32:51: it is my only goal in this world.
00:32:51 - 00:32:53: To win the elections, everything.
00:32:53 - 00:32:56: But one day, when I leave from here,
00:32:56 - 00:32:58: You will go, my eyes will be closed.
00:32:58 - 00:32:59: I should also get the benefit of that.
00:33:00 - 00:33:02: I understood. Do you read very regularly?
00:33:02 - 00:33:04: No, I read a little.
00:33:04 - 00:33:05: You never danced?
00:33:05 - 00:33:09: Did I call you here to ask this question?
00:33:09 - 00:33:14: Now you will have to talk like a Bihari.
00:33:14 - 00:33:15: Now he is laughing.
00:33:15 - 00:33:17: He is scared of SQSC.
00:33:17 - 00:33:21: You were laughing in Bihar because you were scared.
00:33:21 - 00:33:25: Why did you find that question so disturbing?
00:33:25 - 00:33:29: No, no. I have never been asked what dance is.
00:33:29 - 00:33:32: Will you dance at your children's wedding? I don't know if you are married.
00:33:32 - 00:33:35: I am married. I have three daughters.
00:33:35 - 00:33:37: Oh, wow! Wonderful.
00:33:37 - 00:33:39: Are you a grandson?
00:33:39 - 00:33:40: Yes.
00:33:40 - 00:33:41: You have become a grandfather?
00:33:41 - 00:33:42: Absolutely.
00:33:42 - 00:33:44: Okay. Then you are saying you are young.
00:33:44 - 00:33:47: I am young, man.
00:33:47 - 00:33:50: Why not? I am young. I am young now.
00:33:50 - 00:33:51: I will remain young.
00:33:51 - 00:33:54: How attached are you to the grandchildren?
00:33:54 - 00:33:55: There is a different emotion.
00:33:55 - 00:33:56: Very much.
00:33:56 - 00:33:58: The third generation has come to the house.
00:33:58 - 00:34:00: Very much. Yes, why not?
00:34:01 - 00:34:02: How much time do you spend?
00:34:02 - 00:34:03: Do you get time?
00:34:03 - 00:34:07: I try to spend as much time as I get.
00:34:08 - 00:34:10: My daughters are settled in Hyderabad.
00:34:10 - 00:34:12: That's great.
00:34:13 - 00:34:14: Praise be to Allah.
00:34:14 - 00:34:17: You are a little adorable.
00:34:18 - 00:34:18: Who?
00:34:18 - 00:34:20: You are adorable.
00:34:20 - 00:34:23: You know, just an adjective to…
00:34:23 - 00:34:29: You start like this, then you pick it up, and the other person picks it up again.
00:34:29 - 00:34:31: Then you try to bring it down. I have understood you.
00:34:31 - 00:34:35: No, I am not bringing it down. You are adorable.
00:34:35 - 00:34:38: Apart from the Quran, do you read anything?
00:34:38 - 00:34:40: Yes, I read newspapers and books.
00:34:40 - 00:34:41: Which newspaper do you read daily?
00:34:41 - 00:34:43: I read every newspaper. I even read it on the phone.
00:34:44 - 00:34:45: Which book are you reading these days?
00:34:45 - 00:34:49: I have started reading a book.
00:34:49 - 00:34:50: Which one?
00:34:50 - 00:34:57: Zafar-ul-Islam's new book was published on Sawarkar.
00:34:57 - 00:35:00: The one by Vikram Sampat, have you read it?
00:35:00 - 00:35:01: No, no, no, leave that.
00:35:01 - 00:35:02: Oh, you have left that.
00:35:02 - 00:35:05: Leave that. This is authentic.
00:35:05 - 00:35:07: Isn't that authentic?
00:35:07 - 00:35:10: No, no, this is very authentic. It is genuine.
00:35:10 - 00:35:11: Do you write?
00:35:11 - 00:35:14: Not much. There was a time when I used to write a lot.
00:35:14 - 00:35:15: Like poetry and stuff?
00:35:15 - 00:35:19: No, no, no. I used to write whatever came to my mind.
00:35:19 - 00:35:21: Based on what? What would you write on?
00:35:21 - 00:35:24: Many aspects of, but I have stopped it.
00:35:24 - 00:35:27: But many aspects of what? Tell me something.
00:35:27 - 00:35:30: Something happened, this happened, I had to do this, this happened, that happened.
00:35:30 - 00:35:32: I used to write, but...
00:35:33 - 00:35:35: You are the master of generalizing answers.
00:35:35 - 00:35:36: No, no.
00:35:36 - 00:35:37: And not actually answering them.
00:35:37 - 00:35:41: No, no, no. You are making me look like a fool.
00:35:41 - 00:35:43: It's nothing like that, but I am telling the truth.
00:35:43 - 00:35:46: No, I just want you not to generalize so much, and give some spice.
00:35:46 - 00:35:52: Masala dene ka kya hai? Masala nahi hai. Jo sachayi hai usme chhupane hi kya zarurat.
00:35:52 - 00:35:57: Mainne parliament dekhna shuru gaya 2008 mein. Jab no confidence motion chal raha tha.
00:35:57 - 00:35:59: It was a dream then, five years ago. It's a dream now.
00:35:59 - 00:36:02: Just to be able to chill with you and just to be able to do this interview.
00:36:02 - 00:36:05: Most welcome. You are always welcome to come and chill with me.
00:36:05 - 00:36:06: Yeah. All right.
00:36:06 - 00:36:07: In all the halal way.
00:36:10 - 00:36:12: Usko hi pata nahi ban kartega.
00:36:12 - 00:36:21: You are not relevant only. You don't have to ban me.
00:36:21 - 00:36:23: No, no. We were shot.
00:36:23 - 00:36:24: You were shot?
00:36:24 - 00:36:26: Yes, we were shot. We don't have to ban you.
00:36:26 - 00:36:27: Where were you shot?
00:36:27 - 00:36:29: In the UP election.
00:36:29 - 00:36:31: How close was it?
00:36:31 - 00:36:37: So you can understand that if you are on a toll gate and when your car stops,
00:36:37 - 00:36:43: On the left-hand side, there is a place where that person stands.
00:36:43 - 00:36:44: Sure, booth hai wo?
00:36:44 - 00:36:46: It's what, six feet, six and a half feet.
00:36:46 - 00:36:47: Us booth se chalai?
00:36:47 - 00:36:52: Booth ke baaz, booth se pehle, humaar saam mein gaadi thi, humaari gaadi peechay thi.
00:36:52 - 00:36:57: So, I was a bit reclining, suddenly heard a boom sound.
00:36:57 - 00:37:01: So, your normal reaction is what happened? Ane kya hua?
00:37:01 - 00:37:05: So, Yameen Khan who was driving my car, a very good friend of mine, dear friend,
00:37:05 - 00:37:11: dear friend. He said, Bhai, kya baat hai? Then he suddenly said, goli maar ra. He said,
00:37:11 - 00:37:17: turn, you turn and you see someone six feet. Your reaction is, you bend down. Thaw, thaw,
00:37:17 - 00:37:23: thaw. Aapki tarah goli maar ra. Bhai, pehle chalaya to, humko nahi maal raha hu, pehle
00:37:23 - 00:37:26: chal gayi goli. By the time you realise, wo teen round aur fire kar rahe hain, teen yaar
00:37:26 - 00:37:32: chaar round. Aap dekha hos aadmi ko? Bilkul dekha main. Bilkul dekha main. Samme safari
00:37:32 - 00:37:34: We told Yamin to hit him.
00:37:34 - 00:37:36: He was hit.
00:37:36 - 00:37:38: We took him to safari and then we drove the car.
00:37:39 - 00:37:41: Did the car windows break?
00:37:41 - 00:37:45: No, the side door on my side was hit by a bullet.
00:37:45 - 00:37:47: Oh, shit! When did this happen?
00:37:47 - 00:37:49: During the UP elections.
00:37:49 - 00:37:50: Was it in 2017 or 2022?
00:37:50 - 00:37:51: 2022.
00:37:51 - 00:37:52: It happened just now?
00:37:52 - 00:37:52: Yes, in 2022.
00:37:53 - 00:37:55: Didn't you get as much hype as you should have?
00:37:55 - 00:37:57: A national level leader.
00:37:57 - 00:38:01: No, no. First of all, the surprising thing is
00:38:01 - 00:38:07: When we left from there, the tyre got punctured.
00:38:07 - 00:38:08: Okay.
00:38:08 - 00:38:10: I told Yameen to drive the car.
00:38:11 - 00:38:14: We drove the car. The tyre got punctured.
00:38:14 - 00:38:17: The car was moving at 110-120 kmph.
00:38:17 - 00:38:18: It got punctured.
00:38:18 - 00:38:19: Yes.
00:38:19 - 00:38:20: You and Yameen were in the car.
00:38:20 - 00:38:21: Yes, I was Yameen.
00:38:21 - 00:38:23: I tweeted on the way.
00:38:23 - 00:38:24: You tweeted at that time.
00:38:24 - 00:38:25: Yes, I tweeted.
00:38:25 - 00:38:27: I thought there would be another team.
00:38:27 - 00:38:28: Yes.
00:38:28 - 00:38:29: And another attack would be on me.
00:38:29 - 00:38:30: Okay.
00:38:30 - 00:38:39: I told my friend, A. N. I. that this is what happened, you do it.
00:38:39 - 00:38:43: He said, you go now. I said, at least my dying declaration will be done.
00:38:43 - 00:38:45: My mind was on that, that now he is gone.
00:38:45 - 00:38:50: Because when they hit so badly, it was natural that something will happen now.
00:38:50 - 00:38:52: There was trauma as well.
00:38:52 - 00:38:55: No, the trauma is for later.
00:38:55 - 00:39:00: When I reached there, the media people said that HRA is doing a drama for the elections.
00:39:00 - 00:39:02: The media people didn't believe it.
00:39:02 - 00:39:08: When people came to our house, we said that when they saw the car,
00:39:08 - 00:39:15: we sat on a TV channel and they thought that they were doing something.
00:39:15 - 00:39:20: Fortunately, they gave their video.
00:39:20 - 00:39:20: Okay.
00:39:20 - 00:39:23: So, when everyone knew, the footage came.
00:39:23 - 00:39:25: What district was this?
00:39:25 - 00:39:29: This is very close to the story.
00:39:29 - 00:39:31: Yes, it is very close.
00:39:31 - 00:39:36: Later, we found out that the Mahashay had attempted to kill us three times.
00:39:36 - 00:39:42: One time, you won't believe, he gave us coffee.
00:39:42 - 00:39:43: How?
00:39:43 - 00:39:46: After this knowledge or before?
00:39:46 - 00:39:48: No, before. He started following us.
00:39:48 - 00:39:51: One time, he followed us on a journey and we didn't find him.
00:39:51 - 00:39:54: One time, he came to a public meeting and we didn't get a chance.
00:39:54 - 00:39:59: We were returning from Delhi, and we saw a big hotel,
00:39:59 - 00:40:02: so we said, let's have tea or coffee.
00:40:02 - 00:40:04: He said, okay, get everyone a cup.
00:40:04 - 00:40:06: He was following us, how would we know?
00:40:06 - 00:40:08: What was his name?
00:40:08 - 00:40:12: There are two names, I don't remember his name.
00:40:12 - 00:40:15: I remember his face, I remember his face very well.
00:40:15 - 00:40:17: I remember both of their faces.
00:40:17 - 00:40:19: Did he get any custody?
00:40:19 - 00:40:23: No, he was arrested and he was bailed.
00:40:23 - 00:40:24: Who did?
00:40:24 - 00:40:26: BJP people were there.
00:40:26 - 00:40:28: Who got the bail?
00:40:28 - 00:40:30: They were all there.
00:40:30 - 00:40:34: Then we had to go to the Supreme Court.
00:40:34 - 00:40:37: Supreme Court said go back to the High Court.
00:40:37 - 00:40:40: Then their bail got cancelled.
00:40:40 - 00:40:42: We went and cancelled their bail.
00:40:42 - 00:40:44: UP government didn't do it.
00:40:44 - 00:40:46: We got their bail cancelled.
00:40:46 - 00:40:48: They are still in jail.
00:40:48 - 00:40:50: The trial is still going on.
00:40:50 - 00:40:52: Which gun was it?
00:40:52 - 00:40:54: I don't know the gun.
00:40:54 - 00:40:56: I know the sound of the gun.
00:40:56 - 00:40:58: I know how to use it.
00:40:58 - 00:41:00: I have a license.
00:41:00 - 00:41:02: I keep using it.
00:41:02 - 00:41:04: I have seen your gun in the last interview.
00:41:04 - 00:41:06: You took out the gun and kept it in the dashboard.
00:41:06 - 00:41:08: I think it was .32.
00:41:08 - 00:41:10: Okay.
00:41:10 - 00:41:12: The sound was like that.
00:41:12 - 00:41:14: And it was a Kata.
00:41:14 - 00:41:16: Oh, it was a Kata.
00:41:16 - 00:41:18: Have you ever used a Kata?
00:41:18 - 00:41:23: I don't go into these things. I haven't gone into those things yet.
00:41:23 - 00:41:25: And you didn't have security?
00:41:25 - 00:41:26: No, when there was no security in Jammu and Orkut.
00:41:26 - 00:41:27: Now there is.
00:41:27 - 00:41:29: What will we do now?
00:41:29 - 00:41:31: After that, we will have to keep it.
00:41:31 - 00:41:34: The pressure of the house, the pressure of the people, the pressure of the party.
00:41:35 - 00:41:37: Now everyone is taking the wedding procession.
00:41:37 - 00:41:38: So, is it safe to sit with you or not?
00:41:39 - 00:41:40: It is absolutely safe. Don't worry.
00:41:41 - 00:41:43: We are drowning, Sanam. We will drown you too.
00:41:43 - 00:41:46: Because you have a beard and we have a beard.
00:41:46 - 00:41:48: Only one bearded man is safe in this country.
00:41:48 - 00:41:51: The rest are in danger.
00:41:51 - 00:41:53: How much does he want to be liked by Muslims?
00:41:53 - 00:41:55: Do you ever think about that?
00:41:55 - 00:41:56: He does want to be liked by Muslims.
00:41:56 - 00:41:57: No.
00:41:57 - 00:41:58: He's being liked by people.
00:41:58 - 00:42:00: That's why they're voting for him.
00:42:00 - 00:42:01: That's true.
00:42:01 - 00:42:04: That's why he's getting 31% and 37%.
00:42:04 - 00:42:06: People like him so much, he doesn't give a single ticket
00:42:06 - 00:42:07: to Muslims.
00:42:07 - 00:42:10: People like him so much that he says,
00:42:10 - 00:42:12: look at the clothes and recognize them.
00:42:12 - 00:42:14: Now they're saying, look at the food and recognize it.
00:42:14 - 00:42:20: Modi ji asked me why I ate meat and fish.
00:42:20 - 00:42:23: I have a question.
00:42:23 - 00:42:25: If I say that we fast for 30 days in Ramadan,
00:42:25 - 00:42:31: you should not eat or drink water, what will you do?
00:42:31 - 00:42:32: You should say it.
00:42:32 - 00:42:34: I have already said it.
00:42:34 - 00:42:35: Did he say anything?
00:42:35 - 00:42:37: He has not answered yet.
00:42:37 - 00:42:43: We said that Alana is a meat company, a beef company, an export company.
00:42:43 - 00:42:46: 10 crores to BJP, 1.5 crores to Shiv Sena.
00:42:46 - 00:42:49: And who has the shop of meat in Maharashtra?
00:42:49 - 00:42:52: Khureshi and Kathak.
00:42:52 - 00:42:54: How is this? What kind of justice is this?
00:42:54 - 00:42:57: You must have some hypocrisy or not?
00:42:57 - 00:42:58: No, I am...
00:42:58 - 00:43:00: No, I am genuinely asking. You don't have any hypocrisy?
00:43:00 - 00:43:02: Who am I to be an angel?
00:43:02 - 00:43:05: I said in the first interview, where are we angels?
00:43:06 - 00:43:08: Where are we angels? We are trying to be good.
00:43:08 - 00:43:11: Do you ever see a Muslim being Prime Minister of India within your lifespan?
00:43:11 - 00:43:12: Do you think that's a possibility?
00:43:12 - 00:43:22: I have said on record that I want a Muslim woman to be the Prime Minister of this country.
00:43:22 - 00:43:25: One should dream. Without dreaming, you cannot fulfill it.
00:43:26 - 00:43:28: Why did you feel the need to say hijab wearing girl?
00:43:28 - 00:43:29: What is wrong in that?
00:43:29 - 00:43:31: No, no. I am saying why did you feel the need. I am not saying it's wrong.
00:43:32 - 00:43:37: When a hijab wearing girl can do MBBS course
00:43:37 - 00:43:41: in the most prestigious medical colleges of our country,
00:43:41 - 00:43:46: And a hijab-wearing girl can do law in the best universities of our country.
00:43:46 - 00:43:48: Why not the Prime Minister of India?
00:43:48 - 00:43:50: There is no female leadership in MIM.
00:43:50 - 00:43:52: Yes, we are increasing it.
00:43:52 - 00:43:53: You want to increase it?
00:43:53 - 00:43:56: We want to increase it, we are increasing it, and we are increasing it.
00:43:56 - 00:43:56: It is increasing?
00:43:57 - 00:43:58: It is increasing, it is increasing.
00:43:58 - 00:44:02: We have put it at the municipal, corporate and district level.
00:44:02 - 00:44:03: We have to take it further.
00:44:03 - 00:44:05: Who is your favourite comedian?
00:44:05 - 00:44:07: You must not even watch comedy.
00:44:07 - 00:44:08: What is there to watch?
00:44:08 - 00:44:10: He is working for the people in politics.
00:44:10 - 00:44:12: What comedy will he watch?
00:44:12 - 00:44:14: Comedy...
00:44:14 - 00:44:16: Narendra Modi?
00:44:16 - 00:44:18: You will say this only?
00:44:18 - 00:44:20: No, no. Many people do comedy.
00:44:20 - 00:44:22: As much as the people of the ruling party do comedy,
00:44:22 - 00:44:24: no one does it.
00:44:24 - 00:44:26: You have come to the same answer.
00:44:26 - 00:44:28: Is there any answer in which I don't get into politics?
00:44:28 - 00:44:30: You are in the same place as your father.
00:44:30 - 00:44:32: And you are watching so much comedy.
00:44:32 - 00:44:34: What will be bigger than this?
00:44:34 - 00:44:36: Don't you watch Kapil Sharma's show for Escape?
00:44:36 - 00:44:43: Yes, I know. He runs a big TV show. It's a real joke.
00:44:43 - 00:44:46: It's good. People watch it. Who is stopping me?
00:44:46 - 00:44:48: You can't stop me. Who are you to stop you?
00:44:48 - 00:44:50: No, why would I stop you?
00:44:50 - 00:44:52: If people are enjoying it, then enjoy it.
00:44:52 - 00:44:54: It's fun. What do I care?
00:44:54 - 00:44:57: You must not take therapy. You must have never thought about it.
00:44:57 - 00:44:59: What is this?
00:44:59 - 00:45:00: He is a mental health expert.
00:45:00 - 00:45:03: Okay, fine. I have to fool everyone.
00:45:03 - 00:45:04: What is therapy?
00:45:04 - 00:45:06: Leave it. Leave it.
00:45:06 - 00:45:08: Your young voters will get offended.
00:45:08 - 00:45:11: What is offended? I don't know.
00:45:11 - 00:45:16: When a person is sick, they go to a doctor.
00:45:16 - 00:45:18: I am not against it.
00:45:18 - 00:45:22: But politicians need therapy.
00:45:22 - 00:45:23: Politicians.
00:45:23 - 00:45:26: How will we treat the public?
00:45:26 - 00:45:31: If I am sick, I am at home. Sit at home.
00:45:31 - 00:45:32: Do you understand?
00:45:32 - 00:45:34: I understand. Interesting point. Very interesting point.
00:45:34 - 00:45:38: I have a point. This is a fair comment.
00:45:38 - 00:45:42: If I myself am not fit in that,
00:45:42 - 00:45:44: how will I ask for 21 lakh votes?
00:45:44 - 00:45:49: No, but it must be mentally exhausting to take care of 21 lakh people and their aspirations.
00:45:49 - 00:45:53: Why did you come then? Sit at home.
00:45:53 - 00:45:54: When I don't have the strength.
00:45:55 - 00:45:56: Why did you come? You shouldn't have come.
00:45:56 - 00:45:58: Did someone force you? Did someone put a gun on you?
00:45:58 - 00:46:00: Why did you come? Sit at home.
00:46:00 - 00:46:01: If you don't do it, who else will do it?
00:46:01 - 00:46:03: Is this not taxing on the mind?
00:46:03 - 00:46:08: No, it is not. You have to work hard. You have to, you know,
00:46:08 - 00:46:13: decompartmentalize each and everything. You have to learn on it.
00:46:13 - 00:46:17: I have learned it from my elders. I go to people who know much better.
00:46:17 - 00:46:20: How do I take care of it? So, you have to keep on learning.
00:46:20 - 00:46:25: Now, you will say, politicians don't get time in the media.
00:46:25 - 00:46:30: The family doesn't get time. The brother works for 19-20 hours.
00:46:30 - 00:46:32: I don't think we should waste so much time.
00:46:32 - 00:46:35: No one should waste so much time.
00:46:35 - 00:46:38: We get time. Why don't we get time?
00:46:38 - 00:46:42: We get time to exercise for 4 days in a week, 45 minutes.
00:46:42 - 00:46:44: We get time with our wife and kids.
00:46:44 - 00:46:46: We get less time, but we get time.
00:46:46 - 00:46:48: Do you use Spotify?
00:46:48 - 00:46:49: No.
00:46:49 - 00:46:51: Do you use Netflix?
00:46:51 - 00:46:52: Do you have an account?
00:46:52 - 00:46:54: Do you have a party account that you watch?
00:46:54 - 00:46:57: Oh, brother, where is the time for all this?
00:46:57 - 00:46:58: What world are you taking me into?
00:46:58 - 00:47:01: You just said that there is time in this profession.
00:47:01 - 00:47:02: There is no time.
00:47:02 - 00:47:04: If there is time, then wife and kids are there.
00:47:04 - 00:47:05: Responsibility is there.
00:47:05 - 00:47:06: Party is responsible.
00:47:06 - 00:47:08: Watch Netflix with wife and kids.
00:47:08 - 00:47:10: Where is so much time?
00:47:10 - 00:47:11: You try to understand.
00:47:11 - 00:47:12: Come on.
00:47:12 - 00:47:13: No, no.
00:47:13 - 00:47:16: Life will pass in this only.
00:47:16 - 00:47:19: It will be fun to sit and talk.
00:47:19 - 00:47:21: Consuming art is also life.
00:47:21 - 00:47:22: Leave it.
00:47:22 - 00:47:23: It is useless.
00:47:23 - 00:47:25: You sit and talk to your relatives and friends.
00:47:25 - 00:47:26: It will be fun.
00:47:26 - 00:47:28: So, art is consumed.
00:47:28 - 00:47:30: Ten people are sitting and watching.
00:47:30 - 00:47:32: What is the matter?
00:47:32 - 00:47:33: Is that fun?
00:47:33 - 00:47:35: A person should sit and talk,
00:47:35 - 00:47:36: make jokes,
00:47:36 - 00:47:38: talk, learn something.
00:47:38 - 00:47:39: That is fun.
00:47:39 - 00:47:40: You are watching,
00:47:40 - 00:47:41: watching, watching,
00:47:41 - 00:47:42: your eyes are getting bad.
00:47:42 - 00:47:43: Watching.
00:47:43 - 00:47:45: Have you come to watch?
00:47:45 - 00:47:46: Talk to me.
00:47:46 - 00:47:48: When did you get your glasses?
00:47:48 - 00:47:51: I got my glasses in England.
00:47:51 - 00:47:52: Really?
00:47:52 - 00:47:53: Did you ride a bike in England?
00:47:53 - 00:47:54: No, no, no.
00:47:54 - 00:47:56: There is no bike or car in England.
00:47:56 - 00:47:57: The most expensive car was a tube.
00:47:57 - 00:47:59: Which station did you stay in?
00:47:59 - 00:48:00: I stayed in many stations.
00:48:00 - 00:48:02: Did you have to change houses?
00:48:02 - 00:48:05: Rooms, small rooms.
00:48:05 - 00:48:06: Oh, I see.
00:48:06 - 00:48:08: Yes, small rooms.
00:48:08 - 00:48:09: Where did I stay?
00:48:09 - 00:48:11: It was so expensive.
00:48:11 - 00:48:12: Who would have been able to afford a house in London?
00:48:12 - 00:48:14: Maybe you were rich then.
00:48:14 - 00:48:14: I don't know.
00:48:14 - 00:48:15: No, no, no.
00:48:15 - 00:48:16: It's not a question of being rich.
00:48:16 - 00:48:18: I had a small room.
00:48:18 - 00:48:19: Sometimes I shared a room.
00:48:19 - 00:48:23: Sometimes I shared two rooms in a building.
00:48:23 - 00:48:25: I worked in Wimbledon and McDonald's for many years.
00:48:25 - 00:48:29: Really? Which burgers were sold?
00:48:30 - 00:48:36: Big Mac, Chicken Burger, Fries, Fish Burger, Filet-O-Fish
00:48:37 - 00:48:38: Have you ever been to Lords to watch a Test match?
00:48:38 - 00:48:39: No.
00:48:39 - 00:48:39: Ashes?
00:48:40 - 00:48:41: You must have been a fan of Ashes.
00:48:41 - 00:48:42: No, never.
00:48:43 - 00:48:45: Oval? Never?
00:48:45 - 00:48:46: No, never.
00:48:46 - 00:48:48: Have you ever seen cricket in Lords?
00:48:48 - 00:48:50: I used to play cricket there every Sunday.
00:48:50 - 00:48:53: I used to play in the league in London.
00:48:54 - 00:48:55: Did you play well?
00:48:55 - 00:48:59: Achcha Kel De The. Excellent. Achcha Kel De The.
00:48:59 - 00:49:02: Kya Rahte De The? Bowling Kar De The. Fast?
00:49:02 - 00:49:05: Medium Fast. Fast Toh Nahi. Medium Fast. Ok.
00:49:05 - 00:49:09: Har Sunday Jaya Kel De The. Wahe Club. Kisi Club Mein Jaya Kel De The.
00:49:09 - 00:49:14: You are one of the most successful MPs in recent times.
00:49:14 - 00:49:18: Ab India's ever had to mujhe nahi pata. Kyuki mujhe itni history nahi pata parliament ki.
00:49:18 - 00:49:23: But in recent times, you are one of the most active, one of the most successful parliamentarians.
00:49:23 - 00:49:27: What is the secret? There is no secret. What is the key to it, not the secret?
00:49:27 - 00:49:33: See, you must have some commitment towards the people who you represent.
00:49:33 - 00:49:38: And you must always remind yourself, keep on reminding yourself that you
00:49:39 - 00:49:42: represent those people who expect you to talk about them.
00:49:42 - 00:49:49: My problem is that because of my party strength, I get only 6, 7, 9, 10 minutes maximum.
00:49:49 - 00:49:52: maximum. You don't know the amount of people I speak to. You know, you just
00:49:52 - 00:49:57: can't even imagine. My friends, who are very capable.
00:49:57 - 00:50:02: The experts in the domain. Yes, I keep talking to them. Sometimes they get angry.
00:50:02 - 00:50:06: They don't get angry. I tell them to forgive me. You know, I am going to trouble you.
00:50:06 - 00:50:11: They laugh and say, no, ask, ask. But it seems to be an art which is lost now.
00:50:11 - 00:50:17: I mean, using Parliament as that, which you use it as, where did it go? Very few people
00:50:17 - 00:50:19: No, if you don't work hard, what will you do?
00:50:19 - 00:50:23: If you say that my PA will do it, he will make me and give it to me,
00:50:23 - 00:50:25: then it is your fault.
00:50:25 - 00:50:28: You should read it yourself.
00:50:28 - 00:50:34: Okay, you ask everyone, you take it, but what will you say?
00:50:34 - 00:50:38: But the relevance of the parliament has fallen as a place of discussion.
00:50:38 - 00:50:40: Do you see it or is it just…
00:50:40 - 00:50:42: Yes, the government's agenda is being discussed more,
00:50:42 - 00:50:44: the opposition's agenda is not being discussed.
00:50:44 - 00:50:51: and the way bills are being passed in a very short time,
00:50:51 - 00:50:55: and the role of the Standing Committee in the Parliament is decreasing,
00:50:55 - 00:51:02: the biggest loss I think will be the dominance of the Executive in the legislature.
00:51:02 - 00:51:05: The legislature is nowhere to be seen, it has become very less.
00:51:05 - 00:51:12: Unfortunately, the MPs who are coming, they are so afraid of their party
00:51:12 - 00:51:17: party that they can't speak their voice independently.
00:51:17 - 00:51:18: Not at all.
00:51:18 - 00:51:18: Now, where is it?
00:51:18 - 00:51:21: Do you ever see the proceedings of the foreign parliaments?
00:51:21 - 00:51:22: Yes, I do.
00:51:22 - 00:51:24: Like the UK parliament?
00:51:24 - 00:51:25: I see the UK parliament.
00:51:25 - 00:51:27: The question hour is very interesting.
00:51:27 - 00:51:30: How beautiful is that question hour.
00:51:30 - 00:51:31: Oh, man.
00:51:31 - 00:51:33: You can ask any question to the Prime Minister.
00:51:33 - 00:51:34: He has to answer.
00:51:34 - 00:51:36: And there is such an intimate setting.
00:51:36 - 00:51:36: No, no.
00:51:36 - 00:51:42: You tell me how much preparation a Prime Minister must have had.
00:51:42 - 00:51:44: If anyone is standing, ask him.
00:51:44 - 00:51:46: Have you been to other Parliament Houses in the world?
00:51:46 - 00:51:47: Have you ever been to the dignitary?
00:51:47 - 00:51:49: Yes, we went to Turkey.
00:51:49 - 00:51:49: Really?
00:51:49 - 00:51:50: We went to Australia.
00:51:50 - 00:51:52: How was it? Tell us about it.
00:51:52 - 00:51:55: It was a very beautiful Parliament.
00:51:55 - 00:51:58: Especially, Australia's was amazing.
00:51:58 - 00:52:01: It looked like a great Parliament.
00:52:01 - 00:52:03: UK's was very cramped.
00:52:03 - 00:52:06: It was very old.
00:52:06 - 00:52:12: But their support staff system for an MP was very good.
00:52:12 - 00:52:13: What is it?
00:52:13 - 00:52:19: You can hire experts as an MP.
00:52:19 - 00:52:20: Domain experts?
00:52:20 - 00:52:24: Yes, who work with you and give you all the knowledge.
00:52:24 - 00:52:26: There is nothing here.
00:52:26 - 00:52:30: But thankfully, I am very thankful to PRS
00:52:30 - 00:52:33: that they give me a lamp assistant every year.
00:52:33 - 00:52:36: How many push-ups can you do?
00:52:36 - 00:52:39: I won't get it done.
00:52:39 - 00:52:45: No, no, no. Leave that. What is there to do?
00:52:45 - 00:52:49: Now, you will say, how much money do you have in your wallet?
00:52:49 - 00:52:50: Or how do you eat mangoes?
00:52:50 - 00:52:52: How do you eat mangoes?
00:52:52 - 00:52:53: Leave that.
00:52:53 - 00:52:56: I have a question, but it might be offensive.
00:52:56 - 00:52:57: Go ahead.
00:52:57 - 00:52:59: Don't hit me.
00:52:59 - 00:53:01: Why would I hit you?
00:53:01 - 00:53:04: Why don't you have a sprain?
00:53:04 - 00:53:07: I have had a sprain since I left my beard.
00:53:07 - 00:53:08: Okay.
00:53:08 - 00:53:12: Jab se daadi chhoda hu main 1993 se, jab se aise hi chahiye.
00:53:12 - 00:53:19: Is there a religious thing of having this look or is it a personal preference? Because I don't know it.
00:53:19 - 00:53:26: But I see a lot of people do this. No, it is a religious thing also. But the religion does not
00:53:26 - 00:53:32: stops you from having a mooch. Okay. Provided your hair does not touches your…
00:53:32 - 00:53:38: No, not lip, when you eat your food.
00:53:38 - 00:53:40: What is the one thing that you have not been able to do in the constituency?
00:53:41 - 00:53:42: I have not been able to do many things.
00:53:42 - 00:53:44: Which one? Tell me one thing that you have not been able to do.
00:53:44 - 00:53:46: There are many things.
00:53:46 - 00:53:50: We have to do road widening, we have to do the Suraj line.
00:53:50 - 00:53:52: It has been so many years and you have not been able to do it.
00:53:52 - 00:53:56: It has been done. If you are not saying it, then we have to do it.
00:53:56 - 00:53:58: I am saying that we have to do it.
00:53:58 - 00:54:04: Inshallah, the work on the New Sun Line will start in the Chandrayangot Assembly Constancy.
00:54:04 - 00:54:08: Some 350 codes have been sanctioned by the government.
00:54:08 - 00:54:10: So, we have to get work done.
00:54:10 - 00:54:12: We are not saying that we have got everything done.
00:54:12 - 00:54:13: We have to get work done. We will get it done.
00:54:13 - 00:54:15: Don't you ever get bored of this?
00:54:15 - 00:54:16: Why? Why should I get bored?
00:54:16 - 00:54:19: I am just asking. You are human after all.
00:54:19 - 00:54:20: Like you said.
00:54:20 - 00:54:22: Yes, I am a human being. Why?
00:54:22 - 00:54:22: It is my job.
00:54:23 - 00:54:25: Now, I will say tomorrow, leave it. Why are you doing all this?
00:54:25 - 00:54:27: Sometimes, I do get bored.
00:54:27 - 00:54:28: Where do you get bored?
00:54:28 - 00:54:30: I feel tired. I feel monotony.
00:54:30 - 00:54:31: Where?
00:54:31 - 00:54:32: Where?
00:54:32 - 00:54:35: You have been doing this for so many years.
00:54:35 - 00:54:37: You have been doing this for so many years.
00:54:37 - 00:54:38: Don't you feel monotony?
00:54:39 - 00:54:41: No, not at all.
00:54:41 - 00:54:42: Tell me the truth.
00:54:42 - 00:54:43: I am telling the truth.
00:54:43 - 00:54:47: Today, we were on a tour. You were with me, right?
00:54:47 - 00:54:48: No, I was also with you.
00:54:48 - 00:54:48: No, listen.
00:54:49 - 00:54:50: You must have felt the energy.
00:54:50 - 00:54:50: No, listen.
00:54:50 - 00:54:52: Okay, tell me.
00:54:52 - 00:54:55: When we were walking in the sun, sweating,
00:54:55 - 00:54:57: An old woman started crying when she saw me.
00:54:57 - 00:54:59: She said, I am praying a lot for you.
00:54:59 - 00:55:00: You should join.
00:55:00 - 00:55:01: She started crying.
00:55:01 - 00:55:03: I hugged her.
00:55:03 - 00:55:05: She was 70 years old.
00:55:05 - 00:55:08: Now, I realized that even if I give her money, she won't get love.
00:55:08 - 00:55:12: Tell me, who will bring me this love?
00:55:12 - 00:55:13: Now, tell me.
00:55:13 - 00:55:15: Did our people tell you to do this?
00:55:15 - 00:55:17: No.
00:55:17 - 00:55:18: This is the thing.
00:55:18 - 00:55:20: A person should work for this.
00:55:20 - 00:55:23: And do you think you are being able to fulfil what they want out of you?
00:55:23 - 00:55:25: I'm trying to do that.
00:55:25 - 00:55:29: I'm trying to live up to the expectations.
00:55:29 - 00:55:32: Are you really that honest or are you just pretending?
00:55:32 - 00:55:36: I don't care if you're giving me money or not.
00:55:36 - 00:55:37: It's election time.
00:55:37 - 00:55:40: You have to speak on camera.
00:55:40 - 00:55:44: I don't care if it's an election or not.
00:55:44 - 00:55:45: I just want to stay here.
00:55:45 - 00:55:48: I don't want to have another election.
00:55:48 - 00:55:52: You think I have only one election?
00:55:52 - 00:55:59: Bhai sahab, jab meri shaadi hui thi, raat mein meri shaadi hui aur subah mein assembly gaya tha main.
00:55:59 - 00:56:04: In your ideal country, what would be the relationship between religion and state?
00:56:04 - 00:56:07: Jo samvidhan parivahasha deta hai, wahi ya phir?
00:56:07 - 00:56:11: See, we don't follow the western concept of secularism.
00:56:11 - 00:56:15: Despite what Americans say, there is no relation, there is always a relation.
00:56:15 - 00:56:20: So, we celebrate every religion. We even celebrate people who don't believe in any God.
00:56:20 - 00:56:25: This is what secularism is. And the state has no religion. But unfortunately,
00:56:25 - 00:56:32: the state has adopted a religion because the ruling party wants one particular ideology to be followed.
00:56:32 - 00:56:37: To ek mera sawal is pe ye hai ki agar maan liye do religion ho sakte hain,
00:56:37 - 00:56:42: do communities ho sakte hain, do castes ho sakte hain, unmein agar koi dispute hota hai,
00:56:42 - 00:56:47: should the state step in to resolve that or should the state say, hey, we don't
00:56:47 - 00:56:52: We are a third party. We are not involved in these things. How should it happen?
00:56:52 - 00:56:57: Agar koi law and order ka jagda hoga hai toh, law will take its own course.
00:56:57 - 00:57:02: Yeh woh apni jagah hai. Main aap se yeh sawal pooch raha hoon, should, in an ideal
00:57:02 - 00:57:07: setting, what is the relationship between religion, should the state make
00:57:07 - 00:57:10: legislation on religious practices or not?
00:57:10 - 00:57:18: How can the state absorb the authority of the religious teachings of that particular religion?
00:57:18 - 00:57:26: How? For example, essential practice of a religion. How can the state decide what is the essential
00:57:26 - 00:57:33: practice of my religion or anyone's religion? That has to be decided by the scholars of that religion.
00:57:33 - 00:57:36: Kuch toh accha kar rahi hai Maharaj Sarkar, yeh sabhi ki galat ho raha hai.
00:57:36 - 00:57:42: You have incited hatred, you have made hatred common,
00:57:42 - 00:57:45: you have told people that this is a community and you are in danger from them.
00:57:46 - 00:57:48: How do you stop communal tension in your society?
00:57:48 - 00:57:52: You know, sometimes a government may be willing to do it,
00:57:52 - 00:57:56: but there is tension in the society itself, isn't there?
00:57:56 - 00:57:56: No, look…
00:57:57 - 00:57:58: Or the government is the one who sets it on fire.
00:57:58 - 00:58:01: No, anything can happen.
00:58:01 - 00:58:04: The point is that the government pushes it forward.
00:58:04 - 00:58:05: Okay.
00:58:05 - 00:58:09: And it is absolutely true that the police are responsible for the riots.
00:58:09 - 00:58:15: If you free the police and put the police in charge,
00:58:15 - 00:58:21: if that happens, you will be held accountable.
00:58:21 - 00:58:26: The girl who was gang-raped and was pregnant,
00:58:26 - 00:58:32: her daughter, her mother, and her family were killed.
00:58:32 - 00:58:35: Why did you let her killers go?
00:58:35 - 00:58:40: Why? What was the reason?
00:58:40 - 00:58:42: It was an election, you left Gujarat.
00:58:42 - 00:58:46: Now you tell me, did my brother have to go to the Supreme Court?
00:58:46 - 00:58:50: Can you even imagine what a woman had to go through?
00:58:50 - 00:58:54: Do you really think, and I'm asking you honestly, genuinely,
00:58:54 - 00:58:59: that by leaving the convicts who have been convicted of rape,
00:58:59 - 00:59:02: will a voter base be attracted to you?
00:59:02 - 00:59:04: Does this party really feel that way?
00:59:04 - 00:59:06: Of course, they do.
00:59:06 - 00:59:11: They gave them flowers and garlands and welcomed them.
00:59:11 - 00:59:14: What should be the priorities of India according to you?
00:59:14 - 00:59:22: There is poverty, unemployment, education, and there is a lot of need for it.
00:59:22 - 00:59:27: The biggest cause that I see in my constituency and in the entire urban area of India,
00:59:27 - 00:59:31: the biggest cause of debt is when poor people fall ill.
00:59:31 - 00:59:33: They say that they don't have the money to get treatment.
00:59:33 - 00:59:36: You can say that we have taken out a scheme, but still…
00:59:37 - 00:59:40: But the insurance that the central government gives in terms of Ayushman is not…
00:59:40 - 00:59:43: You say, where are the hospitals? What is the waiting list?
00:59:43 - 00:59:46: Where will the treatment be done?
00:59:46 - 00:59:50: And there are priorities that should be there for the country, but they are not there.
00:59:50 - 00:59:52: They are not there, not at all.
00:59:52 - 00:59:54: Does the average voter care about these things?
00:59:54 - 00:59:58: The average voter cares to some extent.
00:59:58 - 00:59:58: Okay.
00:59:58 - 01:00:00: Not much.
01:00:00 - 01:00:02: How tall are you?
01:00:02 - 01:00:04: Get me a tape.
01:00:04 - 01:00:06: Tell me.
01:00:06 - 01:00:08: Get me a tape.
01:00:08 - 01:00:10: Get me this too.
01:00:10 - 01:00:12: Forget all that.
01:00:12 - 01:00:14: Sing a song and I'll let you go.
01:00:14 - 01:00:16: I don't sing.
01:00:16 - 01:00:18: Just one song.
01:00:18 - 01:00:20: I don't remember.
01:00:20 - 01:00:22: How can you not remember?
01:00:22 - 01:00:24: You must remember a few songs.
01:00:24 - 01:00:26: No, I don't remember.
01:00:26 - 01:00:28: You remember the lyrics, right? Sing it.
01:00:28 - 01:00:31: No, I don't remember anything.
01:00:31 - 01:00:32: Tell me the height.
01:00:32 - 01:00:34: I'll get a tape and measure it.
01:00:34 - 01:00:35: Maybe it's too high.
01:00:35 - 01:00:36: I don't know.
01:00:36 - 01:00:39: I don't know.
01:00:39 - 01:00:44: If I become a Vishwa Guru, I'll probably grow taller.
01:00:44 - 01:00:45: You'll definitely grow taller.
01:00:45 - 01:00:47: The country is going up.
01:00:47 - 01:00:48: I'll probably grow taller.
01:00:48 - 01:00:49: That's true.
01:00:49 - 01:00:50: I don't know.
01:00:50 - 01:00:52: If Modi Ji takes you along, it'll be fun.
01:00:52 - 01:00:55: We're together in the matter of the country.
01:00:55 - 01:00:56: We should be together.
01:00:56 - 01:00:58: I am not with them, I am with the country.
01:00:58 - 01:00:59: There is no doubt about that.
01:01:00 - 01:01:01: On that note, Mr. Ovesi,
01:01:01 - 01:01:02: Thank you, sir.
01:01:02 - 01:01:07: I will let you go now, but looking at this camera,
01:01:07 - 01:01:08: what was your experience?
01:01:08 - 01:01:10: How much did I irritate you?
01:01:10 - 01:01:14: And people should subscribe to my channel, Unfiltered by Samdesh.
01:01:14 - 01:01:18: First, look at him, he is a crazy person.
01:01:18 - 01:01:19: Who?
01:01:19 - 01:01:20: He is a crazy person.
01:01:20 - 01:01:22: What do you mean by crazy?
01:01:22 - 01:01:27: He is crazy and stubborn.
01:01:27 - 01:01:29: But he has a good heart.
01:01:29 - 01:01:33: And he is hardworking.
01:01:33 - 01:01:34: Is that what you are saying?
01:01:34 - 01:01:38: He is hardworking and you should definitely subscribe to him.
01:01:38 - 01:01:40: And you can trust his words.
01:01:40 - 01:01:42: He is not a duplicate.
01:01:42 - 01:01:43: He is not sold yet.
01:01:43 - 01:01:47: The light went off as soon as he said that.
01:01:47 - 01:01:48: Oh man.
01:01:48 - 01:01:50: Should we do something funny?
01:01:50 - 01:01:51: Do it, man.
01:01:54 - 01:01:55: Do a dance pose.
01:01:56 - 01:01:56: Do one.
01:01:56 - 01:01:57: Do one like this.
01:01:57 - 01:01:58: Do one like this.
01:01:59 - 01:02:00: Do it, man.
01:02:00 - 01:02:02: Hey, call him three times.
01:02:02 - 01:02:04: Call him three times and take him in your arms.
01:02:05 - 01:02:06: What? What's that?
01:02:06 - 01:02:07: We'll tell you now.
01:02:08 - 01:02:09: Do a thumbs up like this.
01:02:09 - 01:02:10: Yes.
01:02:11 - 01:02:12: Don't do it like this.
01:02:12 - 01:02:13: No, like this.
01:02:20 - 01:02:27: I'll see you next time!
