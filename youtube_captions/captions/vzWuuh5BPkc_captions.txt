00:05:05 - 00:05:11: question I don't want to like okay
00:05:08 - 00:05:14: everyone is influenced by somebody when
00:05:11 - 00:05:16: I watch you I see and tell me if you
00:05:14 - 00:05:19: like this or if you don't I see a
00:05:16 - 00:05:22: combination of Eric Andre and Zack
00:05:19 - 00:05:25: galanakis I see a hybrid you are your
00:05:22 - 00:05:27: own person you are your own individual
00:05:25 - 00:05:28: but I see that flow and I was curious
00:05:27 - 00:05:30: what you thought about that so you guys
00:05:28 - 00:05:34: ask me in m
00:05:30 - 00:05:34: no I don't think I asked that at
00:05:38 - 00:05:45: all you could say you don't like it I
00:05:41 - 00:05:47: was asking so I look up to both of them
00:05:45 - 00:05:51: that was a good answer and I also like
00:05:47 - 00:05:54: uh what's the guy of stepb Brothers yes
00:05:51 - 00:05:56: will faroh will far yes hey you met him
00:05:54 - 00:05:58: yeah I know everybody you got his number
00:05:56 - 00:06:00: of course I do do you feel like he would
00:05:58 - 00:06:02: pick up if you face time them probably
00:06:00 - 00:06:04: if I can name a celebrity I feel like if
00:06:02 - 00:06:07: you FaceTime them they wouldn't pick
00:06:04 - 00:06:09: up I'm going think of somebody I don't
00:06:07 - 00:06:10: so anytime you use your phone and you
00:06:09 - 00:06:14: you will put money on it that they would
00:06:10 - 00:06:17: pick up for shake 99% of the time
00:06:14 - 00:06:19: yeah I feel that all the time sometimes
00:06:17 - 00:06:21: I get a sh 50 Cent you can FaceTime 50
00:06:19 - 00:06:23: Cent right now day every day huh all day
00:06:21 - 00:06:27: every day so if you FaceTime 50 Cent
00:06:23 - 00:06:29: right now $500 cash he'll pick up
00:06:27 - 00:06:31: yeah that is a fun experiment I do kind
00:06:29 - 00:06:34: of to try
00:06:31 - 00:06:36: it I don't have my phone with me oh oh
00:06:34 - 00:06:39: yeah get his
00:06:36 - 00:06:41: pH trick it's upstairs go get not
00:06:39 - 00:06:44: callback he has to pick up yeah he'll
00:06:41 - 00:06:46: pick up if Shaq were to FaceTime you
00:06:44 - 00:06:48: first time you're picking up or he never
00:06:46 - 00:06:50: Pi I mean me I'm a groupy so I'll pick
00:06:48 - 00:06:52: it up he never picks up I'm fine with
00:06:50 - 00:06:53: picking up yeah so what I'm trying to
00:06:52 - 00:06:57: say is like it's it's in a different
00:06:53 - 00:06:59: field like they neck and neck so I got a
00:06:57 - 00:07:03: question your style of interview did you
