00:27:35 - 00:27:41: not talk I'm talking about the kids that
00:27:38 - 00:27:44: it's it's just a health thing that
00:27:41 - 00:27:46: nature is that this book said that the
00:27:44 - 00:27:48: kids with the healthiest immune systems
00:27:46 - 00:27:51: were from the furthest apart furthest
00:27:48 - 00:27:54: apart geographically so what's farther
00:27:51 - 00:27:55: apart geographically cuz uh you saying
00:27:54 - 00:27:57: black and white is farther apart GE
00:27:55 - 00:27:58: geographically well no just because like
00:27:57 - 00:28:00: it's
00:27:58 - 00:28:02: we're not farther apart geographically
00:28:00 - 00:28:04: cuz you know your people rape my people
00:28:02 - 00:28:07: so that's why I'm I'm whatever the hell

00:28:28 - 00:28:33: like is that European and then African
00:28:30 - 00:28:35: so they they kind of they both deal with
00:28:33 - 00:28:37: the same different climates and come
00:28:35 - 00:28:39: together exact they take the best parts
00:28:37 - 00:28:40: of their DNA and immune systems and
00:28:39 - 00:28:42: things that they've developed and then
00:28:40 - 00:28:44: combined to one but it also could take
00:28:42 - 00:28:46: the worst Parts they should I mean you

00:30:02 - 00:30:07: made a run away I made a run away is
00:30:05 - 00:30:10: that here was his foot like that that
00:30:07 - 00:30:11: was from foot binding so there's a thing
00:30:10 - 00:30:13: yeah to keep their feet from I think I
00:30:11 - 00:30:15: don't think this is a current thing I
00:30:13 - 00:30:16: might be off who knows but I learned
00:30:15 - 00:30:18: about it in school where it was like an
00:30:16 - 00:30:20: ancient way for Chinese women to keep
00:30:18 - 00:30:23: their feet small and demure so they
00:30:20 - 00:30:25: would bind their feet into like this did
00:30:23 - 00:30:28: you say the word demure I did is that
00:30:25 - 00:30:30: even did I use it even correctly but
00:30:28 - 00:30:32: they like would more or less fold them

00:31:39 - 00:31:42: here we call it the P the parent of the
00:31:41 - 00:31:44: week because Mike and I are both parents
00:31:42 - 00:31:46: Miss Pat's parent we talk about like
00:31:44 - 00:31:48: just a parent who did something now we
00:31:46 - 00:31:50: got Justin Timberlake got arrested on
00:31:48 - 00:31:52: DWI charges in the Hampton this was not
00:31:50 - 00:31:54: a big story which it it just came at it
00:31:52 - 00:31:56: just dropped now oh so it didn't drop
00:31:54 - 00:31:57: when it happened no I think I think they
00:31:56 - 00:31:59: probably let him go for a little while
00:31:57 - 00:32:01: it sounds like off the back of Father's
00:31:59 - 00:32:03: day though right so on Father's Day he
00:32:01 - 00:32:05: got he got drunk in Sag Harbor and he
00:32:03 - 00:32:07: drove and he got but I mean which we've
00:32:05 - 00:32:09: been there we've done that gig that Sag
00:32:07 - 00:32:12: Harbor theater they wait have you done
00:32:09 - 00:32:14: that I mean it is like it's straight up
00:32:12 - 00:32:17: Alec Baldwin country out there like it
00:32:14 - 00:32:20: is Rich wa Long Island ever drove uh
00:32:17 - 00:32:22: drunk or actually maybe I have maybe I
00:32:20 - 00:32:24: have when I was younger so just got
00:32:22 - 00:32:25: arrested like he got arrested which I
00:32:24 - 00:32:27: thought would be a bigger story but I
00:32:25 - 00:32:30: guess people really just don't care
00:32:27 - 00:32:32: anymore got arrested for driving drunk
00:32:30 - 00:32:34: to keep it quiet yeah I think he just
00:32:32 - 00:32:38: has a good publicist that probably kept
00:32:34 - 00:32:40: it out of the news yeah wow I uh yeah so
00:32:38 - 00:32:42: he he was driving drunk in the Hampton
00:32:40 - 00:32:44: and you're saying Mike this parent WECT
00:32:42 - 00:32:45: it's coming off the heels of Father's
00:32:44 - 00:32:47: Day very clearly he had a good day
00:32:45 - 00:32:49: celebrating himself had a good time
00:32:47 - 00:32:51: probably should have hired a driver he's

00:34:26 - 00:34:31: think I would like moving into um
00:34:29 - 00:34:34: theaters and you know leaving the clubs
00:34:31 - 00:34:36: because the clubs are so personal I I
00:34:34 - 00:34:38: like to one night and get up out of here
00:34:36 - 00:34:41: got one one done you're also like a
00:34:38 - 00:34:43: power act so like you you can fill a
00:34:41 - 00:34:46: theater with your voice and with your
00:34:43 - 00:34:47: comedy to make it feel intimate where
00:34:46 - 00:34:49: sometimes when people don't you know
00:34:47 - 00:34:51: other acts that don't move around as
00:34:49 - 00:34:54: much or don't fill the space as much it
00:34:51 - 00:34:58: could feel like cavernous right yeah I
00:34:54 - 00:35:00: like I I did theaters for the last three
00:34:58 - 00:35:01: years but I this next one I want to go
00:35:00 - 00:35:03: back to the comedy clubs in certain
00:35:01 - 00:35:05: markets just because I feel like a comic
00:35:03 - 00:35:07: there more I feel like you know ceilings
00:35:05 - 00:35:09: are low and it's one of those things too
00:35:07 - 00:35:10: where like I mean this is a little
00:35:09 - 00:35:12: inside baseball but you sometimes you
00:35:10 - 00:35:13: just make more money too at the comedy
00:35:12 - 00:35:16: clubs you do because the theat you got
00:35:13 - 00:35:17: to understand for for the fans that
00:35:16 - 00:35:19: don't know like when we we do these
00:35:17 - 00:35:22: theater shows it's it's amazing but it's
00:35:19 - 00:35:23: so costly that's why sometimes the
00:35:22 - 00:35:25: ticket prices are higher because just
00:35:23 - 00:35:27: for us to flip the light on at the
00:35:25 - 00:35:29: theater the union is going to C you know
00:35:27 - 00:35:31: charge you all all this money where the
00:35:29 - 00:35:32: comedy clubs you just go in it's all
00:35:31 - 00:35:35: about the comedy do do you remember I
00:35:32 - 00:35:37: almost cost you 10 grand at Radio City
00:35:35 - 00:35:38: why because I was like I didn't know I
00:35:37 - 00:35:39: didn't know the union rules or anything
00:35:38 - 00:35:41: like that you guys had already walked
00:35:39 - 00:35:43: out onto the stage and checked out the
00:35:41 - 00:35:44: space and then I was like oh can I walk
00:35:43 - 00:35:46: out and somebody was like whatever and I
00:35:44 - 00:35:49: went to walk out and literally as I got
00:35:46 - 00:35:51: on the stage like no no no union union
00:35:49 - 00:35:54: and they pulled me off the stage just

00:37:37 - 00:37:41: 10 minutes and then we'll be done yeah
00:37:39 - 00:37:44: I'm going outside that's why I'm oh
00:37:41 - 00:37:46: you're going outside ex did she go out
00:37:44 - 00:37:49: Jazz okay yeah go f but do not go
00:37:46 - 00:37:51: outside by yourself okay look both ways
00:37:49 - 00:37:54: don't talk to strangers that's it we got
00:37:51 - 00:37:56: a trampoline in the yard it's the best
00:37:54 - 00:37:58: thing I've ever done in my life not only
00:37:56 - 00:38:00: do my kids go in it all the kids from
00:37:58 - 00:38:04: the neighborhood are in my trampoline
00:38:00 - 00:38:06: for like 6 hours a day every day I does
00:38:04 - 00:38:08: that insurance-wise scare you I never
00:38:06 - 00:38:10: even thought of that until now take it
00:38:08 - 00:38:12: down you you know cuz if somebody get
00:38:10 - 00:38:15: injured you got to pay I do that's like
00:38:12 - 00:38:17: a huge liability the trampoline
00:38:15 - 00:38:19: homeowners well just other kids on it
00:38:17 - 00:38:22: but here's the thing but I'm renting
00:38:19 - 00:38:24: this house do you have rental this do
00:38:22 - 00:38:25: you have rental insurance I think I have
00:38:24 - 00:38:27: rental insurance so if you have rental
00:38:25 - 00:38:29: insurance they still can sue you against
00:38:27 - 00:38:31: rental insurance but since I'm the
00:38:29 - 00:38:33: renter of this house I wonder if it
00:38:31 - 00:38:35: would all lie on the owner of the house
00:38:33 - 00:38:37: no it would lie on you because you let
00:38:35 - 00:38:38: those kids in your backyard and you own
00:38:37 - 00:38:39: the trampoline I mean that's just like
00:38:38 - 00:38:42: if somebody came in your yard and got
00:38:39 - 00:38:44: bit by your dog or came in your yard and
00:38:42 - 00:38:46: slipped it's all on it's all on you you
00:38:44 - 00:38:48: I mean it's not on the owner because she
00:38:46 - 00:38:50: rented you the property so it's your
00:38:48 - 00:38:52: responsibility would you sue anybody
00:38:50 - 00:38:54: could you have it in you to sue somebody
00:38:52 - 00:38:58: hell yeah I sue somebody I sue my tenant
00:38:54 - 00:39:00: I sue everybody I'm too old to be fight
00:38:58 - 00:39:01: [ __ ] yeah that's what the that's what
00:39:00 - 00:39:05: the law is for when's the last time you
00:39:01 - 00:39:07: sued somebody um I sued my tenant for uh
00:39:05 - 00:39:10: tearing up my rental property okay
00:39:07 - 00:39:12: that's fair yeah why did they do that uh
00:39:10 - 00:39:16: she was stupid and we ended up on Judge
00:39:12 - 00:39:18: Joe Brown wow yeah we ended up on uh
00:39:16 - 00:39:20: yeah it air it was a year got a question
00:39:18 - 00:39:23: is that is that where the inspiration
00:39:20 - 00:39:26: came for your show uh
00:39:23 - 00:39:29: no no we did an episode on the Miss Pat
00:39:26 - 00:39:31: show and now we we we we kind of got an
00:39:29 - 00:39:34: idea about a court show and we pitched
00:39:31 - 00:39:36: it and bet went for it and we put it on
00:39:34 - 00:39:39: BET instead of bet plus so I just shot
00:39:36 - 00:39:41: the second season of uh Miss Pat settles
00:39:39 - 00:39:44: it Miss Pat's crushing it Chris if Chris
00:39:41 - 00:39:47: and a a parent of a child came on the
00:39:44 - 00:39:49: Miss Pat judge show how would you rule
00:39:47 - 00:39:52: if a kid got like broke their leg on his
00:39:49 - 00:39:54: trampoline you uh I would probably rule
00:39:52 - 00:39:56: for the parents because you allowed that
00:39:54 - 00:39:59: child to come on your property yeah but
00:39:56 - 00:40:00: what am I suppos to do not let the kids
00:39:59 - 00:40:02: on the
00:40:00 - 00:40:04: property uh make them sign a waiver tell
00:40:02 - 00:40:06: them get the hell out your backyard that
00:40:04 - 00:40:08: would be great if you had just ndas

00:40:10 - 00:40:14: have them all sign it you have a lawyer
00:40:12 - 00:40:15: I do have a lawyer you have to get their
00:40:14 - 00:40:18: parents to sign it though cuz if you're
00:40:15 - 00:40:20: also forcing under
00:40:18 - 00:40:21: children from the start this whole thing
00:40:20 - 00:40:23: is sketchy because you've announced that
00:40:21 - 00:40:24: you're just calling all the children of
00:40:23 - 00:40:26: the neighborhood to come over to your
00:40:24 - 00:40:28: backyard now what you could do is you
00:40:26 - 00:40:30: can pull your trampoline to the street
00:40:28 - 00:40:32: and whoever get Hur in the street is
00:40:30 - 00:40:35: it's the city that's a good idea if I
00:40:32 - 00:40:36: have it actually on the sidewalk no no
00:40:35 - 00:40:39: in the street but it's still your
00:40:36 - 00:40:41: propert like I don't know I no no no no
00:40:39 - 00:40:43: I was told I was cuz I just no no your
00:40:41 - 00:40:44: property being the trampoline is your
00:40:43 - 00:40:46: propert no he threw it on the street I
00:40:44 - 00:40:49: threw it on the street because I called
00:40:46 - 00:40:51: 311 yesterday because I want 311 uh 311
00:40:49 - 00:40:53: it's like in New York like it's like uh

00:40:53 - 00:40:59: like uh when you need like uh it's like
00:40:55 - 00:40:59: the city just gives you information on
00:40:59 - 00:41:03: so so I had to discard of my air
00:41:02 - 00:41:05: conditioners but I knew that you can't
00:41:03 - 00:41:07: just put an air conditioner out they
00:41:05 - 00:41:08: have to take the freon out cuz the the
00:41:07 - 00:41:10: chemicals and the air conditioner can
00:41:08 - 00:41:12: blow up in the back of the truck so I
00:41:10 - 00:41:14: said oh you know what am I supposed to
00:41:12 - 00:41:16: do and they said well just put the air
00:41:14 - 00:41:19: conditioners face out in front by your
00:41:16 - 00:41:20: tree they said and the garbage the dsny
00:41:19 - 00:41:22: department of sanitation is going to
00:41:20 - 00:41:24: come next week and take the freon out I
00:41:22 - 00:41:26: said okay and they said but make sure
00:41:24 - 00:41:29: it's out past your tree cuz then that is
00:41:26 - 00:41:30: city property it's not your property so
00:41:29 - 00:41:31: they said if it's on your property we're
00:41:30 - 00:41:33: not going to take it out it has to be on
00:41:31 - 00:41:36: the city property so they looked at my
00:41:33 - 00:41:37: address and they said at that tree line
00:41:36 - 00:41:39: that is not your property did they come
00:41:37 - 00:41:40: get it no they're coming next week but

00:54:30 - 00:54:33: sure Betty will be hearing about this
00:54:32 - 00:54:37: and it's another thing I have to [ __ ]
00:54:33 - 00:54:39: deal with um so I just get I get
00:54:37 - 00:54:41: destroyed in therapy like you can't
00:54:39 - 00:54:42: imagine I just get [ __ ] just crushed
00:54:41 - 00:54:44: why is everybody in therapy you know
00:54:42 - 00:54:45: what Miss Pat can we talk about this I
00:54:44 - 00:54:47: want to actually talk about this for
00:54:45 - 00:54:50: real I think we're in too much therapy I
00:54:47 - 00:54:51: think the more you talk about this [ __ ]
00:54:50 - 00:54:52: other than of course if you're using
00:54:51 - 00:54:56: better help and use a promo code chaos
00:54:52 - 00:54:59: do that but I think that we there's such
00:54:56 - 00:55:01: a thing about therapy now we're talking
00:54:59 - 00:55:03: too much and you're making your problems
00:55:01 - 00:55:04: bigger than they are sometimes you go to
00:55:03 - 00:55:05: therapy you don't even have anything to
00:55:04 - 00:55:06: talk about but then you have to make
00:55:05 - 00:55:08: something up and then you you're you
00:55:06 - 00:55:11: make yourself sicker than you actually
00:55:08 - 00:55:12: are do you agree well I have better help
00:55:11 - 00:55:15: too so I say you call better help before
00:55:12 - 00:55:15: you call
00:55:15 - 00:55:21: me Bo everybody need a therapist now
00:55:19 - 00:55:23: everybody glad of that because back in
00:55:21 - 00:55:25: the day people wouldn't go to therapy
00:55:23 - 00:55:27: and you know they would deal with their
00:55:25 - 00:55:29: problem by walking in the G in a grocery
00:55:27 - 00:55:31: store with a gun so I'm glad people are
00:55:29 - 00:55:33: starting to deal with it course correct
00:55:31 - 00:55:35: like it's I feel right now people are
00:55:33 - 00:55:37: going much now I also think that like
00:55:35 - 00:55:40: the problem with therapy is that you're
00:55:37 - 00:55:43: dealing with a with a business that is
00:55:40 - 00:55:46: built in the hearts and minds of its
00:55:43 - 00:55:48: patients so like it's it's basically at
00:55:46 - 00:55:51: at homeostasis it's a manipulative
00:55:48 - 00:55:53: business so it's hard to trust another
00:55:51 - 00:55:55: human being to do the right thing and to
00:55:53 - 00:55:58: actually serve you as opposed to just
00:55:55 - 00:56:00: keep you in the pay cycle of paying for
00:55:58 - 00:56:01: you know not really help but just to
00:56:00 - 00:56:04: jerk off in front of somebody every week
00:56:01 - 00:56:06: exactly jerk off I mean emotionally jerk
00:56:04 - 00:56:08: off in front of somebody by being th let
00:56:06 - 00:56:10: you jerk off I've had a good therapy
00:56:08 - 00:56:12: like therapy you like to therapy I think
00:56:10 - 00:56:14: it's good I think we have a m for jazz
00:56:12 - 00:56:16: and then everybody speak speak over
00:56:14 - 00:56:18: [ __ ] I can just speak if you're
00:56:16 - 00:56:20: going to talk tell your girlfriend the
00:56:18 - 00:56:22: same thing because before therapy came
00:56:20 - 00:56:23: along therapy to black people was
00:56:22 - 00:56:26: calling your friend let me tell you what
00:56:23 - 00:56:27: this [ __ ] did MH yeah but it's
00:56:26 - 00:56:29: just a vicious cycle then you keep going
00:56:27 - 00:56:30: back and forth but let me tell you what
00:56:29 - 00:56:32: happened and then you just keep there's
00:56:30 - 00:56:34: no resoltion wait Jaz can you speak it
00:56:32 - 00:56:35: to the mic we can't hear you I call you
00:56:34 - 00:56:38: to tell you my problem I don't want to
00:56:35 - 00:56:40: hear that [ __ ] you talking you find
00:56:38 - 00:56:44: you a friend with no problems oh my God
00:56:40 - 00:56:46: you know that's mean okay okay no I I
00:56:44 - 00:56:47: like it when somebody offers you tools
00:56:46 - 00:56:49: to like hey you should approach it with
00:56:47 - 00:56:51: this this and this it's like great
00:56:49 - 00:56:52: instead of just like letting me punch
00:56:51 - 00:56:56: myself
00:56:52 - 00:56:58: out oh sorry um I wasn't I was say well
00:56:56 - 00:57:00: no but do you think that I'm doing well
00:56:58 - 00:57:02: in therapy in our sessions what are you
00:57:00 - 00:57:06: in therapy for I don't even know anymore
00:57:02 - 00:57:08: sucking nuts sucking a nut sucking nuts
00:57:06 - 00:57:10: they both asked she asked if I was gay
00:57:08 - 00:57:11: in therapy last week and the therapist
00:57:10 - 00:57:12: and I thought the therapist was going to
00:57:11 - 00:57:16: say of course not but the therapist went
00:57:12 - 00:57:18: well Chris this is the
00:57:16 - 00:57:19: crossroads I mean when you take five
00:57:18 - 00:57:22: minutes to answer a question like that
00:57:19 - 00:57:24: like before I'm on a podcast being silly
00:57:22 - 00:57:27: willy hello can you blame me for
00:57:24 - 00:57:30: questioning it did you suck a nut
00:57:27 - 00:57:33: no uh yes still taking you what no not
00:57:30 - 00:57:37: not or would you what a kiss you kiss
00:57:33 - 00:57:39: somebody n 20 years ago you gay think
00:57:37 - 00:57:44: you were
00:57:39 - 00:57:47: 19 no I'm kidding I'm kidding I know I
00:57:44 - 00:57:50: find this I'm joking is he gay is he gay
00:57:47 - 00:57:52: he said you ain't gay no see he knows
00:57:50 - 00:57:54: and he was it was it a truth or dare fun
00:57:52 - 00:57:56: sleepover thing no it's just you know
00:57:54 - 00:58:01: how it is it's [ __ ] white people [ __ ]
00:57:56 - 00:58:03: you know so did he kiss no you're not
00:58:01 - 00:58:05: gay my friend my friend Johnny molested
00:58:03 - 00:58:07: me while I was at a party I was asleep
00:58:05 - 00:58:09: and I woke up to everybody laughing and
00:58:07 - 00:58:11: he had apparently like cued my nuts and
00:58:09 - 00:58:12: I don't remember that so that's kind of
00:58:11 - 00:58:15: a molestation without memory St your
00:58:12 - 00:58:17: nuts like I guess you just do you go to
00:58:15 - 00:58:18: therapy for that no that's just
00:58:17 - 00:58:20: something I've suppressed until this
00:58:18 - 00:58:22: very moment Chris was assaulted in a
00:58:20 - 00:58:25: sauna recently I was assaulted in a
00:58:22 - 00:58:28: sauna uh two weeks ago in London I told
00:58:25 - 00:58:29: that story and um but but but that
00:58:28 - 00:58:30: actually that's a check mark for me in
00:58:29 - 00:58:33: the straight column because I think if I
00:58:30 - 00:58:35: was gay you had every opportunity to to
00:58:33 - 00:58:37: be intimate with a man in the steam room
00:58:35 - 00:58:38: and I did not do that I said please get
00:58:37 - 00:58:40: out of my way I just I said hey I
00:58:38 - 00:58:42: respect you in your community but get
00:58:40 - 00:58:43: the [ __ ] out of my way what did he want
00:58:42 - 00:58:45: he no he took his towel he got butt
00:58:43 - 00:58:47: naked and told me I was a beautiful man
00:58:45 - 00:58:48: in the sauna and asked me if I was gay
00:58:47 - 00:58:50: cuz I went to this bar in London let me
00:58:48 - 00:58:52: ask you something and you was too damn
00:58:50 - 00:58:54: Dum to ask him was he paying what do you
00:58:52 - 00:58:56: mean oh paying paying wow oh you
00:58:54 - 00:58:59: probably missed millions of W I know
00:58:56 - 00:59:02: right we didn't even we didn't cross
00:58:59 - 00:59:03: that bridge he the gym I mean he would
00:59:02 - 00:59:05: he would have much money but then you
00:59:03 - 00:59:07: would spend it all on therapy that's
00:59:05 - 00:59:07: true well the bar that I went to was
00:59:07 - 00:59:11: called
00:59:07 - 00:59:14: meater you only have tragic you only
00:59:11 - 00:59:17: have tragic [ __ ] when it's not
00:59:14 - 00:59:19: good well if it wasn't worth
00:59:17 - 00:59:23: it no you're not you're not is our time

00:59:23 - 00:59:27: out there is it this yeah yeah yeah
00:59:25 - 00:59:29: you're definitely no you're attracted to
00:59:27 - 00:59:31: women but you do like to spend time with
00:59:29 - 00:59:32: men like you do like but not like
00:59:31 - 00:59:34: physically like you like he likes to
00:59:32 - 00:59:36: like just hang out with men well Jasmine
00:59:34 - 00:59:39: has told me she's told me multiple times
