00:09:06 - 00:09:09: [ __ ] go I just feel like that's
00:09:08 - 00:09:12: really I feel like he's become David
00:09:09 - 00:09:13: Brent and he has a bit like he tweeted a
00:09:12 - 00:09:15: picture where he's got like a wolf
00:09:13 - 00:09:17: behind him yeah he's like roaring like a
00:09:15 - 00:09:19: and then he said oh what if I released a
00:09:17 - 00:09:20: movie about me and this guy and I was
00:09:19 - 00:09:22: like this isn't a joke is it like this

00:09:32 - 00:09:35: yeah whereas in the office it's like
00:09:34 - 00:09:37: he's a [ __ ] but like eventually he's
00:09:35 - 00:09:38: sort of like warm to him because he's
00:09:37 - 00:09:40: trying to be yeah you're not supposed to
00:09:38 - 00:09:42: tell me to like him yeah exactly I

00:18:50 - 00:18:56: yeah well music [ __ ] I'm not enjoying
00:18:54 - 00:19:00: these 10 songs but they're the ones that
00:18:56 - 00:19:01: you do listen to as well I don't like uh
00:19:00 - 00:19:03: generally speaking I'm not one of those
00:19:01 - 00:19:04: people that will ever listen to
00:19:03 - 00:19:07: something that I haven't listened to
00:19:04 - 00:19:09: before generally speaking I have to be
00:19:07 - 00:19:12: exposed to it and then like it and then
00:19:09 - 00:19:13: bother to find it out I'm not like you
00:19:12 - 00:19:14: sit and you listen to what you were
00:19:13 - 00:19:16: saying the other day I have to listen to
00:19:14 - 00:19:20: several Albert an album several times in
00:19:16 - 00:19:22: order to work out what a waste of time I
00:19:20 - 00:19:22: think especially
00:19:24 - 00:19:28: no that's never been the case with me I
00:19:27 - 00:19:30: either like it or I don't like it

00:19:30 - 00:19:33: you won't have the the bit of like you
00:19:31 - 00:19:36: know like it's even meatloaf or it's not
00:19:33 - 00:19:38: yeah exactly exactly if it's not
00:19:36 - 00:19:39: meatloaf it's not good that's this guy's
00:19:38 - 00:19:41: energy
00:19:39 - 00:19:43: I think especially with rap music grows
00:19:41 - 00:19:44: on you because like there's so many
00:19:43 - 00:19:46: limits you don't get the first time

00:20:40 - 00:20:45: something that really makes me not look
00:20:42 - 00:20:50: a great one no don't worry he's not
00:20:45 - 00:20:52: racist he's just thick and a bit racist
00:20:50 - 00:20:54: listen I'll tell you what I'll tell you
00:20:52 - 00:20:55: what I wasn't a father Buster Ramsay's
00:20:54 - 00:20:57: music but when he was in Shawshank
00:20:55 - 00:21:01: Redemption
00:20:57 - 00:21:03: my God what a performance that is a film
00:21:01 - 00:21:06: I would [ __ ] watch though to be fair
00:21:03 - 00:21:09: shot could be amazing it'd get caught
00:21:06 - 00:21:10: quick it'd be loud down the tunnel in it
00:21:09 - 00:21:12: what has he known for being very large
00:21:10 - 00:21:14: yeah he's a bit yeah he's kind of
00:21:12 - 00:21:17: changed though anyway he used to be like
00:21:14 - 00:21:20: kind of wild and now he's like he got to
00:21:17 - 00:21:22: like 45 and decided he's a coke dealer
00:21:20 - 00:21:24: and raps slow and now he's really hard

00:23:26 - 00:23:31: and then David walliams will call you a
00:23:28 - 00:23:33: con yeah ironically oh I saw that Stones
00:23:31 - 00:23:35: around this glass house that's really
00:23:33 - 00:23:37: funny as well like what happened is like
00:23:35 - 00:23:39: they keep their mics like running during
00:23:37 - 00:23:41: I have heard about it but I haven't seen
00:23:39 - 00:23:43: it so they do like uh they do like
00:23:41 - 00:23:45: apparently like they do an itv2 show
00:23:43 - 00:23:47: with a show little bits of banter
00:23:45 - 00:23:49: between the acts yes it's uh presented
00:23:47 - 00:23:52: by Stephen mulhern yeah see this he
00:23:49 - 00:23:54: knows about uh yeah because it's on
00:23:52 - 00:23:56: telly yeah uh but yeah like so they were
00:23:54 - 00:23:58: running in between and apparently called
00:23:56 - 00:23:59: one of the contestants are con or
00:23:58 - 00:24:00: whatever yeah there was another one
00:23:59 - 00:24:02: where he's like
00:24:00 - 00:24:04: she's one of those girls that she thinks
00:24:02 - 00:24:06: you want to [ __ ] her but you don't want
00:24:04 - 00:24:09: to [ __ ] her yeah and then it's like oh I
00:24:06 - 00:24:12: can't believe that it's like mate if if
00:24:09 - 00:24:15: like when we were doing beat the frog or
00:24:12 - 00:24:18: whatever if they might took my thoughts
00:24:15 - 00:24:20: [ __ ] me right but thoughts and things
00:24:18 - 00:24:22: you say out loud into a microphone are
00:24:20 - 00:24:24: too dark
00:24:22 - 00:24:27: things that are separate are they
00:24:24 - 00:24:27: I think a lot of things
00:24:29 - 00:24:33: but if we were both doing yeah uh for
00:24:32 - 00:24:36: some reason Britain's Got Talent and
00:24:33 - 00:24:38: we're judging it imagine the [ __ ]
00:24:36 - 00:24:40: [ __ ] that would be the nicest things
00:24:38 - 00:24:42: I've ever said about sure that's why
00:24:40 - 00:24:44: we're not getting booked on ITV on
00:24:42 - 00:24:46: Saturday night right he's going to be a
00:24:44 - 00:24:48: children's children's books in every
00:24:46 - 00:24:50: musician and
00:24:48 - 00:24:52: like anyway like there's quite a lot of
00:24:50 - 00:24:54: um well allegations floating around the
00:24:52 - 00:24:55: internet that no one really gives a [ __ ]
00:24:54 - 00:24:56: but as soon as he calls someone a [ __ ]
00:24:55 - 00:24:58: that's the bit that's like what are the
00:24:56 - 00:25:01: allegations I couldn't possibly repeat
00:24:58 - 00:25:03: in a library well I don't know so tell
00:25:01 - 00:25:07: me and then I'll just say it that's not
00:25:03 - 00:25:08: how the law works I don't think I was
00:25:07 - 00:25:11: just telling him has he done it has he
00:25:08 - 00:25:13: done a rape no I don't know but the
00:25:11 - 00:25:16: allegations the allegations are teenage
00:25:13 - 00:25:18: okay of David walliams so wait so he did
00:25:16 - 00:25:20: I don't you know these are just rumors
00:25:18 - 00:25:22: on Twitter I don't believe them but that
00:25:20 - 00:25:24: doesn't mean that I don't that wink was
00:25:22 - 00:25:26: a joke that he legally is this that he
00:25:24 - 00:25:30: did a teenager or in his teenage years
00:25:26 - 00:25:32: he did a rape what's the oh I think
00:25:30 - 00:25:34: like either of them whichever one you
00:25:32 - 00:25:36: want okay I want the truth right I think
00:25:34 - 00:25:39: he's the reason that um Matt Lucas has
00:25:36 - 00:25:41: got alopecia right he calls that but
00:25:39 - 00:25:43: every time he does a rape he plucks a
00:25:41 - 00:25:45: her out
00:25:43 - 00:25:47: he shaves him every night when he's
00:25:45 - 00:25:48: asleep is that honestly trying never I
00:25:47 - 00:25:49: never heard that's it like there's some
00:25:48 - 00:25:51: stuff Miller around I don't know the
00:25:49 - 00:25:52: veracity of it you know but like it's
00:25:51 - 00:25:54: weird that that sort of light has not
00:25:52 - 00:25:55: been picked up at all but then just like
00:25:54 - 00:25:58: calling someone to come it's a big story
00:25:55 - 00:26:00: oh I just don't think that's the bad bit
00:25:58 - 00:26:02: it's like how my new fans are currently
00:26:00 - 00:26:04: angry because Ronaldo has criticize the
00:26:02 - 00:26:07: facilities at the club and not the rape

00:26:17 - 00:26:21: courts to decide right yeah yeah well I
00:26:19 - 00:26:24: think they've decided that they can't be
00:26:21 - 00:26:25: asked so now now that he has criticized
00:26:24 - 00:26:28: a club I do think he's a rape oh yeah

00:32:14 - 00:32:20: butt plug-in it was a bit nerve-wracking
00:32:17 - 00:32:21: turbulence would feel horrible yeah I
00:32:20 - 00:32:22: reckon it helps with deep vein
00:32:21 - 00:32:27: thrombosis
00:32:22 - 00:32:31: keeps the circulation moving in it
00:32:27 - 00:32:31: oh I guess I've been through turbulence
00:32:32 - 00:32:36: it was a bit nerdy
00:32:34 - 00:32:38: the only person to use a sick bucket to
00:32:36 - 00:32:40: capture a jizz
00:32:38 - 00:32:42: um it was a it was a bit nerve-wracking
00:32:40 - 00:32:44: but I had a previously gone through
00:32:42 - 00:32:46: security with a normal butt plug-in
00:32:44 - 00:32:48: without incident so I had a sense of
00:32:46 - 00:32:49: charm and faith that we'd both make it
00:32:48 - 00:32:51: through I mean he's not making it
00:32:49 - 00:32:54: through
00:32:51 - 00:32:56: uh I would pack him in the in the check
00:32:54 - 00:32:58: luggage if I was able to take the urn
00:32:56 - 00:32:59: overseas with me so she's got an earn a
00:32:58 - 00:33:01: swell does she like scoop a bit of his
00:32:59 - 00:33:05: Ash into it has it got like a chain yes
00:33:01 - 00:33:05: he's just got a gram of him in the books
00:33:08 - 00:33:12: Wyclef Jean delivers it
00:33:15 - 00:33:21: with [ __ ] 20 bag of boyfriend dashes
00:33:24 - 00:33:27: I didn't make the sense to be for
00:33:26 - 00:33:29: anything and then the friend I was with
00:33:27 - 00:33:31: was aware of well the butt plug was
00:33:29 - 00:33:34: gifted to me sorry the friend was aware
00:33:31 - 00:33:37: as well oh my God Friend by the way if
00:33:34 - 00:33:40: you get started to get started
00:33:37 - 00:33:42: my boyfriend is currently up my ass just
00:33:40 - 00:33:45: no no no no just stop there because this
00:33:42 - 00:33:47: gets even [ __ ] weirder the plug was
00:33:45 - 00:33:50: gifted to me before the passing of an
00:33:47 - 00:33:53: ex-boyfriend I had as a teenager
00:33:50 - 00:33:55: so it's not even like they were gonna
00:33:53 - 00:33:56: they were boyfriend and girlfriend for
00:33:55 - 00:33:58: years and gonna get married this is
00:33:56 - 00:34:01: somebody who she dated when she was a
00:33:58 - 00:34:03: teenager died she got this butt plug
00:34:01 - 00:34:05: gifted to her and she [ __ ] rammed his
00:34:03 - 00:34:08: ashes up there the passing of an
00:34:05 - 00:34:10: ex-boyfriend I had as a teenager like
00:34:08 - 00:34:12: ex-boyfriend sounds like you mate yeah
00:34:10 - 00:34:14: it sounds like she got the butt plug
00:34:12 - 00:34:16: from one but the next one died and she
00:34:14 - 00:34:19: put him in it like recycling nudes is
00:34:16 - 00:34:22: bad enough yeah yeah but like recycling
00:34:19 - 00:34:23: your like ash but plug what was she
00:34:22 - 00:34:25: keeping in it before
00:34:23 - 00:34:29: ironic that it's called Forever in it
00:34:25 - 00:34:31: like you know like until the next yeah
00:34:29 - 00:34:33: either that's happened oh yeah it's like
00:34:31 - 00:34:34: did they break up and then she went oh I
00:34:33 - 00:34:37: feel bad now stick him up in your ass
00:34:34 - 00:34:39: yeah the intention was initially a joke
00:34:37 - 00:34:41: because he spent so much time in there
00:34:39 - 00:34:44: and it was his favorite place this is
00:34:41 - 00:34:46: someone's daughter yeah this is a
00:34:44 - 00:34:49: daughter it was his favorite that's like
00:34:46 - 00:34:52: so much time in there yeah imagine a
00:34:49 - 00:34:52: [ __ ] arcade or something
00:34:52 - 00:34:58: a little Memorial plaque above her
00:34:55 - 00:35:00: [ __ ] would have been the funniest
00:34:58 - 00:35:03: a lower back plaque
00:35:00 - 00:35:03: gone
00:35:07 - 00:35:13: here lies Johnny love to be here and
00:35:10 - 00:35:16: feed the Ducks it's this is just [ __ ]
00:35:13 - 00:35:18: insane like mud in it every bit of it is
00:35:16 - 00:35:19: insane
00:35:18 - 00:35:21: um but you know what a way to go oh
00:35:19 - 00:35:23: there's a there's a picture of it yeah
00:35:21 - 00:35:25: it's got a little ribbon tied around it
00:35:23 - 00:35:28: actually can get it back out
00:35:25 - 00:35:29: in case it gets lost in it yeah it's in
00:35:28 - 00:35:32: case there's another book oh my God
00:35:29 - 00:35:32: there's another carriage
00:35:35 - 00:35:39: just read this sentence Sarah didn't
00:35:37 - 00:35:41: have too much luck when she visited Abu
00:35:39 - 00:35:45: Dhabi airport in the United Arab
00:35:41 - 00:35:48: Emirates in 2019 only to end up banned
00:35:45 - 00:35:50: from the Gulf yeah I don't think they
00:35:48 - 00:35:52: take my boyfriend is up my ass because
00:35:50 - 00:35:54: he loved it
00:35:52 - 00:35:55: and I'll tell you what this is another
00:35:54 - 00:35:58: reason why they shouldn't be having the
00:35:55 - 00:35:58: World Cup in Qatar
00:36:00 - 00:36:05: oh
00:36:01 - 00:36:07: [ __ ] hell uh so I explained what it
00:36:05 - 00:36:08: was there uh but there was a lady worker
00:36:07 - 00:36:09: with an earshot of the conversation
00:36:08 - 00:36:11: which led to some back and forth between
00:36:09 - 00:36:14: us and the male officials did not like
00:36:11 - 00:36:16: the vulgarity I was using to explain I
00:36:14 - 00:36:19: mean in early sense how do you explain
00:36:16 - 00:36:23: this without vulgarity I have stored my
00:36:19 - 00:36:23: deceased partner in my anal cavity
00:36:24 - 00:36:28: that's wild it's great isn't it do you
00:36:27 - 00:36:30: know what at the end I've just read a
00:36:28 - 00:36:33: sentence where she says moral of the
00:36:30 - 00:36:37: story there isn't a moral of the story
00:36:33 - 00:36:39: this is one of esop's fables this is the
00:36:37 - 00:36:40: tortoise and the hair and the [ __ ]
00:36:39 - 00:36:43: slag in the butt plug what are you on

00:39:23 - 00:39:27: those old coal miners with the shuffle
00:39:33 - 00:39:36: I guess
00:39:39 - 00:39:43: responsible for scooping the ashes out
00:39:41 - 00:39:45: of my [ __ ] thing it's gonna grow up
00:39:43 - 00:39:49: to be the greatest fighter the world has
00:39:45 - 00:39:52: ever seen pure knockout power from
00:39:49 - 00:39:56: working on plug already in the ashes

00:52:46 - 00:52:49: YouTube
00:52:54 - 00:52:57: which of the videos they've been sent in
00:52:55 - 00:52:59: would you least like to be the star of
00:52:57 - 00:53:02: the one where someone gets their dick
00:52:59 - 00:53:04: off slowly there we go I haven't seen
00:53:02 - 00:53:04: these videos
00:53:07 - 00:53:10: especially there's a woman with a mask a
00:53:08 - 00:53:12: mask on uh just right over your shoulder
00:53:10 - 00:53:16: there with the white mask
00:53:12 - 00:53:18: yeah she in that video it pans down and
00:53:16 - 00:53:19: she's just holding someone's knob and
00:53:18 - 00:53:22: she just with a really sharp knife in
00:53:19 - 00:53:23: about four or five cuts just cuts it off
00:53:22 - 00:53:26: yeah she's wearing gloves and everything
00:53:23 - 00:53:28: and like it's all like a procedure I
00:53:26 - 00:53:30: mean I don't know how you fake it yeah
00:53:28 - 00:53:32: the dick the dick cut off one is look if
00:53:30 - 00:53:34: they were Faking It they'd have faked it
00:53:32 - 00:53:36: in better surroundings so he just has a
00:53:34 - 00:53:38: stump now yeah well no he's got like uh
00:53:36 - 00:53:40: three quarters of a [ __ ] it's all cut
00:53:38 - 00:53:43: they cut it about halfway down yeah yeah
00:53:40 - 00:53:46: the technique is what I'm impressed with
00:53:43 - 00:53:48: what like not like down middle like a
00:53:46 - 00:53:48: sausage sandwich
00:53:48 - 00:53:57: a bit brown sauce

00:54:18 - 00:54:22: yeah well you are gonna have to have a
00:54:20 - 00:54:25: sit down piss yes that is very much the
00:54:22 - 00:54:26: case yeah I I think it's a really easy
00:54:25 - 00:54:28: answer that question it's anything with
00:54:26 - 00:54:30: [ __ ] being cut off yeah because that's
00:54:28 - 00:54:31: not the best question about Joe peers do
00:54:30 - 00:54:33: a better question because obviously like
00:54:31 - 00:54:34: it's bad to like you know have a [ __ ] in
00:54:33 - 00:54:37: your mouth or whatever but we have
00:54:34 - 00:54:39: videos of like someone sent me several
00:54:37 - 00:54:41: videos of people dying stop doing that

00:56:15 - 00:56:20: Bill yeah
00:56:17 - 00:56:22: no the the actual like the thing that
00:56:20 - 00:56:24: jumps out is when I was a teenager my
00:56:22 - 00:56:25: mates we go around with mate's house to
00:56:24 - 00:56:27: like smoke weeds because he had a big
00:56:25 - 00:56:28: back garden and like shed at the bottom
00:56:27 - 00:56:30: of it we could smoke weed in and he's
00:56:28 - 00:56:33: mum in their bedroom there was a big
00:56:30 - 00:56:36: portrait on the wall of his mum topless
00:56:33 - 00:56:38: so we'd all like go to the bathroom just
00:56:36 - 00:56:40: like you know like like looking at his
00:56:38 - 00:56:41: mom's tits so yeah a picture of his
00:56:40 - 00:56:43: mum's tits I'll tell you what he's a
00:56:41 - 00:56:46: very lucky boy that camera phones didn't
00:56:43 - 00:56:47: exist oh God yeah like everyone had a
00:56:46 - 00:56:49: big brother who just had loads of
00:56:47 - 00:56:51: [ __ ] like yeah loads of knives or
00:56:49 - 00:56:53: like the guy before the internet man
00:56:51 - 00:56:54: people just the guy who knows pressure
00:56:53 - 00:56:57: points there was always like I don't
00:56:54 - 00:56:58: know about this every estate as a guy
00:56:57 - 00:57:00: who knows pressure points yeah they're
00:56:58 - 00:57:04: like no all right don't mess if I touch
00:57:00 - 00:57:04: you there you'll [ __ ] die yeah
00:57:06 - 00:57:11: but if it was real that's how every UFC
00:57:09 - 00:57:13: fight would end so I'm gonna just go
00:57:11 - 00:57:16: I've thought that before like pressure
00:57:13 - 00:57:18: before the internet there was so many
00:57:16 - 00:57:22: people who used to teach self-defense
00:57:18 - 00:57:23: yeah yeah or like qualifications any
00:57:22 - 00:57:26: areas
00:57:23 - 00:57:28: yeah yeah yeah like Steven Seagal is one
00:57:26 - 00:57:29: of them guys Steven Seagal is fully one
00:57:28 - 00:57:31: of them this video is like people
00:57:29 - 00:57:32: running up to him and just collapsing by
00:57:31 - 00:57:34: him just pointing at him and [ __ ] like
00:57:32 - 00:57:37: he's like ah the energy yeah yeah yeah
00:57:34 - 00:57:39: but I reckon Steven Seagal is so deluded
00:57:37 - 00:57:40: he probably believes he's doing it yeah
00:57:39 - 00:57:42: even though he's paid actors he's still
00:57:40 - 00:57:45: like can we get a video of that up if
00:57:42 - 00:57:47: you search for bullshito which is uh
00:57:45 - 00:57:50: what they what they call it yeah some of
00:57:47 - 00:57:52: these uh yeah yeah so some of these are
00:57:50 - 00:57:54: brilliant video I [ __ ] love it yeah
00:57:52 - 00:57:57: the story of Steven Seagal getting put
00:57:54 - 00:57:59: uh he said on a movie set or um nobody
00:57:57 - 00:58:03: can chalk me out I can get out of it and
00:57:59 - 00:58:06: uh when he [ __ ] himself
00:58:03 - 00:58:06: [ __ ]
00:58:08 - 00:58:13: that's a brutal [ __ ] wake up isn't it
00:58:10 - 00:58:15: yeah when you wake up to [ __ ] pants
00:58:13 - 00:58:16: yeah I listened to a whole podcast about
00:58:15 - 00:58:18: why you stay punching a bit balls as
00:58:16 - 00:58:20: well now we got out of the Chuck yeah
00:58:18 - 00:58:22: that was his technique yeah so he's like
00:58:20 - 00:58:24: oh I've got his techniques get out of
00:58:22 - 00:58:26: any Chokehold and it's just punching in
00:58:24 - 00:58:28: the dick that's his big thing I'm just
00:58:26 - 00:58:30: [ __ ] yourself I'll [ __ ] myself me

00:58:30 - 00:58:35: six-year-old being tickled that's an
00:58:33 - 00:58:37: excellent [ __ ] thing that's an advert

00:58:45 - 00:58:50: oh [ __ ] he's just sneezed on me classic
00:58:47 - 00:58:50: martial artists
00:58:52 - 00:58:56: it says video will play after our there
00:58:55 - 00:58:58: had already been an advert before it was
00:58:56 - 00:59:00: finished
00:58:58 - 00:59:03: this is why we hit you with stuff here
00:59:00 - 00:59:05: there we go telling us that he's fine
00:59:03 - 00:59:07: with his feet
00:59:05 - 00:59:11: oh this is like a levitation one yeah
00:59:07 - 00:59:11: [ __ ] this dude no skip on a bit more
00:59:13 - 00:59:19: oh here we go I like these
00:59:17 - 00:59:23: oh yeah
00:59:19 - 00:59:26: ridiculous sit down Sunshine oh he's got
00:59:23 - 00:59:26: like that that's a good one
00:59:28 - 00:59:31: did that with his head
00:59:34 - 00:59:39: every town in Britain had one of these
00:59:37 - 00:59:41: dudes teaching people like everyone and
00:59:39 - 00:59:43: like dead they'd all come in the pub
00:59:41 - 00:59:45: thinking they knew how to fight and just
00:59:43 - 00:59:48: get sparked by some Sky I actually think
00:59:45 - 00:59:51: as well the majority of martial arts is
00:59:48 - 00:59:53: bollocks so I think like a lot of them
00:59:51 - 00:59:55: are something like karate I think it
00:59:53 - 00:59:57: only works if they know karate as well
00:59:55 - 01:00:00: chances are they're [ __ ] better no
00:59:57 - 01:00:02: like there is like uh there are like
01:00:00 - 01:00:04: karate practitioners who've done well in
01:00:02 - 01:00:05: UFC like Stephen Wonderboy Thompson has
01:00:04 - 01:00:07: a karate base that's where he started
01:00:05 - 01:00:10: there's not many it's not only one
01:00:07 - 01:00:12: [ __ ] winged shorts no way that's a
01:00:10 - 01:00:14: [ __ ] thing there's loads that are
01:00:12 - 01:00:17: bulls it's been proven by testing in the
01:00:14 - 01:00:20: UFC to see which ones work and it's
01:00:17 - 01:00:22: Jiu-Jitsu [ __ ] wrestling kickboxing
01:00:20 - 01:00:25: yeah yeah that's about it and people
01:00:22 - 01:00:28: still debate whether it's a type of
01:00:25 - 01:00:28: wrestling that they do in Dagestan
01:00:29 - 01:00:33: yeah it's a bit like Jujitsu it's a bit
01:00:31 - 01:00:35: like wrestling I imagine I imagine Judo
01:00:33 - 01:00:37: would work quite well as well for like
01:00:35 - 01:00:40: who does one of them [ __ ] ones yeah
01:00:37 - 01:00:42: like there's no Judo guys in UFC also as
01:00:40 - 01:00:44: well I'm a little bit I ain't heard of
01:00:42 - 01:00:47: Judah for years it must be I'm I'm a
01:00:44 - 01:00:49: little bit scared of bagels now
01:00:47 - 01:00:51: wow
01:00:49 - 01:00:54: I mean that's excellent that's an
01:00:51 - 01:00:54: excellent joke
01:00:59 - 01:01:03: some of them well enough
01:01:02 - 01:01:04: see that's the great thing about dead
01:01:03 - 01:01:08: men talking there's loads of different
01:01:04 - 01:01:08: layers you've got to listen a few times
01:01:08 - 01:01:12: anyone who's listening to this like
01:01:11 - 01:01:14: on repeat
01:01:12 - 01:01:16: any of our episodes over again yeah some
01:01:14 - 01:01:18: people uh like I reckon there's two or
01:01:16 - 01:01:20: three of our fans I'm [ __ ] scared of
01:01:18 - 01:01:22: there's a few of them where I'm like no
01:01:20 - 01:01:24: I feel like if you like something you'd
01:01:22 - 01:01:26: like the only time I'd really watch a
01:01:24 - 01:01:28: podcast Marlon wants is like so I'm
01:01:26 - 01:01:29: showing someone something yeah like does
01:01:28 - 01:01:31: it have to be a really good there's
01:01:29 - 01:01:33: enough of these episodes you can get
01:01:31 - 01:01:36: onto another one yeah yeah yeah
01:01:33 - 01:01:38: so Judo doesn't work as far as I know I
01:01:36 - 01:01:39: don't know I wouldn't want to it's not
01:01:38 - 01:01:41: what I'm certain is [ __ ] but I think
01:01:39 - 01:01:42: he's on the ball of the line where I
01:01:41 - 01:01:44: reckon there's probably some use but
01:01:42 - 01:01:46: there's better ones I'm skeptical of any
01:01:44 - 01:01:48: martial art where you have to wear a
01:01:46 - 01:01:50: [ __ ] gee sort of like Jiu Jitsu yeah
01:01:48 - 01:01:52: I'm skeptical yeah where it's a call of
01:01:50 - 01:01:53: jujitsu I'm just saying I could knock
01:01:52 - 01:01:55: them all out
01:01:53 - 01:01:56: right well we've got a future challenge
01:01:55 - 01:01:58: coming up we're gonna go to a dude this
01:01:56 - 01:02:00: one this one's going out to you Paddy

01:02:32 - 01:02:37: but no to be clear Jujitsu is one of the
01:02:34 - 01:02:40: ones that default works yeah yeah bricky
01:02:37 - 01:02:42: leg Yeah like jiu jitsu's really like

01:04:11 - 01:04:15: skill you've ever [ __ ] seen it just

01:04:23 - 01:04:26: little warm-up one it was a good choice
01:04:24 - 01:04:28: of a starter that's in fact it's not
01:04:26 - 01:04:30: even a star it's a little parity it's
01:04:28 - 01:04:33: not even a pair of teeth it's the uh
01:04:30 - 01:04:35: handshake that you get from the maitre d
01:04:33 - 01:04:35: yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
01:04:37 - 01:04:42: um right let's uh what should we go for
01:04:39 - 01:04:44: [ __ ] dick yeah that's the one I didn't
01:04:42 - 01:04:47: want you so we've been running a [ __ ]
01:04:44 - 01:04:48: dick competition right and refused to
01:04:47 - 01:04:50: judge this we've crowned a winner
01:04:48 - 01:04:52: already but like we've had a light
01:04:50 - 01:04:55: entrance and they haven't followed all
01:04:52 - 01:04:57: the uh criteria on a bit of paper and a
