00:00:00 - 00:00:05: this chat GPT tutorial is a small crash
00:00:03 - 00:00:07: course for any beginner so we'll be
00:00:05 - 00:00:09: doing a number of things from creating a
00:00:07 - 00:00:12: brand new account on openai to logging
00:00:09 - 00:00:13: and using chat gbt to some of the more
00:00:12 - 00:00:15: advanced ways to use it if there's
00:00:13 - 00:00:17: anything you want to know this video
00:00:15 - 00:00:19: should cover it all let's begin I'm
00:00:17 - 00:00:22: going to start on Google here and I'm
00:00:19 - 00:00:25: gonna browse to find open AI you can
00:00:22 - 00:00:28: also head over to openai.com if you want
00:00:25 - 00:00:30: to skip this step here is the company
00:00:28 - 00:00:32: that basically created chat GPT they've
00:00:30 - 00:00:34: created a number of different types of
00:00:32 - 00:00:36: apis and if you want to have a look at
00:00:34 - 00:00:38: them all you can head over to the API
00:00:36 - 00:00:41: page we're going to be looking at the
00:00:38 - 00:00:42: chat GPT version if you want to head to
00:00:41 - 00:00:45: that you should be able to select the
00:00:42 - 00:00:46: top nav bar here this will take you to a
00:00:45 - 00:00:48: page called
00:00:46 - 00:00:50: chat.openai.com if you don't already
00:00:48 - 00:00:52: have a login with openai you can select
00:00:50 - 00:00:54: to sign up and create a brand new one
00:00:52 - 00:00:57: for the sign up it's quite easy you can
00:00:54 - 00:00:59: simply log in with an email address or
00:00:57 - 00:01:01: with a Google or Microsoft account while
00:00:59 - 00:01:03: I already you have an account I'm going
00:01:01 - 00:01:04: to create a brand new one so that you
00:01:03 - 00:01:07: guys can see this process I'm going to
00:01:04 - 00:01:09: sign up with a new email address and go
00:01:07 - 00:01:11: through the prompts to create an account
00:01:09 - 00:01:13: this way this will require the email
00:01:11 - 00:01:16: address as well as a password and a
00:01:13 - 00:01:18: two-step verification process which will
00:01:16 - 00:01:20: do the first thing that will happen is
00:01:18 - 00:01:22: an email will be sent to the mailbox
00:01:20 - 00:01:24: that you're signed up with in this case
00:01:22 - 00:01:27: it'll be sent to my gmail address I'm
00:01:24 - 00:01:29: going to head over to that inbox now and
00:01:27 - 00:01:32: we're going to select the verification
00:01:29 - 00:01:34: for email address button this will
00:01:32 - 00:01:36: basically activate the account so we can
00:01:34 - 00:01:40: log straight into the open AI systems
00:01:36 - 00:01:42: now the open AI dashboard isn't chat GPT
00:01:40 - 00:01:44: it's a separate dashboard to start using
00:01:42 - 00:01:47: some of their normal models here for
00:01:44 - 00:01:49: their open AI systems but to go back to
00:01:47 - 00:01:51: chatgpt we need to select the link up
00:01:49 - 00:01:55: here that takes us to chat.openai.com
00:01:51 - 00:01:58: here we'll need to log in one more time
00:01:55 - 00:01:59: and this should take us to the chat GPD
00:01:58 - 00:02:02: system so again I'm going to put in my
00:01:59 - 00:02:05: email address as well as my password in
00:02:02 - 00:02:07: here and this will now finally take me
00:02:05 - 00:02:09: to chat GPT as this is the very first
00:02:07 - 00:02:11: time I'm using it I need to fill out
00:02:09 - 00:02:14: just a few more details so here I'm
00:02:11 - 00:02:16: going to fill out my name as well as my
00:02:14 - 00:02:18: phone number which will verify my
00:02:16 - 00:02:20: account this will send me that two-step
00:02:18 - 00:02:23: verification so I'll put in the code I
00:02:20 - 00:02:26: received on my phone number and finally
00:02:23 - 00:02:27: we're now in chat GPT and its systems
00:02:26 - 00:02:30: and we can start to use it the first
00:02:27 - 00:02:32: thing to know is that chat GPT is free
00:02:30 - 00:02:34: and it's mainly used right now for
00:02:32 - 00:02:36: research purposes there are a few
00:02:34 - 00:02:39: prompts worth reading here when you get
00:02:36 - 00:02:40: started things like their goal here is
00:02:39 - 00:02:43: to get some external feedback in order
00:02:40 - 00:02:45: to continue to improve the system as
00:02:43 - 00:02:48: well as making it safer they also have a
00:02:45 - 00:02:50: few safeguards in place because there
00:02:48 - 00:02:53: are occasions where the generations are
00:02:50 - 00:02:55: incorrect or even misleading so be aware
00:02:53 - 00:02:58: of that because if offensive or biased
00:02:55 - 00:03:01: Pro content is produced then you might
00:02:58 - 00:03:03: not want to use the given device let's
00:03:01 - 00:03:06: have a look at what else is being used
00:03:03 - 00:03:08: here so we also have the collection of
00:03:06 - 00:03:11: data so the prompts and items that you
00:03:08 - 00:03:13: are entered in are actually reviewed by
00:03:11 - 00:03:15: their AI trainers in order to improve
00:03:13 - 00:03:17: the systems so this means just take
00:03:15 - 00:03:19: notice of what kind of prompts you're
00:03:17 - 00:03:21: putting in and also don't share
00:03:19 - 00:03:22: sensitive informations that might be
00:03:21 - 00:03:24: happening inside your conversations
00:03:22 - 00:03:26: which means that if you're putting in
00:03:24 - 00:03:29: passwords which really you shouldn't be
00:03:26 - 00:03:32: try not to post screenshots of that
00:03:29 - 00:03:34: there's also a importance of feedback
00:03:32 - 00:03:36: here because as you do discover and
00:03:34 - 00:03:39: utilize the system more giving feedback
00:03:36 - 00:03:41: can help them improve the system there
00:03:39 - 00:03:43: is a Discord server that you can join
00:03:41 - 00:03:45: where you can share your feedback and
00:03:43 - 00:03:47: this one over here is actually
00:03:45 - 00:03:50: accessible so I'm just gonna log into
00:03:47 - 00:03:53: this open AI one and it already has half
00:03:50 - 00:03:56: a million members which wow that is
00:03:53 - 00:03:58: quite a few you'll need to go through
00:03:56 - 00:04:01: the prompts here so visit the website
00:03:58 - 00:04:03: make sure that you read this and then
00:04:01 - 00:04:05: complete the little survey here making
00:04:03 - 00:04:07: sure that you're not going to be doing
00:04:05 - 00:04:10: anything such as spamming or anything
00:04:07 - 00:04:12: like that so I've just applied here and
00:04:10 - 00:04:14: here we've got all our discussion
00:04:12 - 00:04:16: threads and whatnot so you can join as
00:04:14 - 00:04:20: part of the community now let's begin
00:04:16 - 00:04:22: this is chat GPT it actually has a
00:04:20 - 00:04:23: couple of elements here on the page
00:04:22 - 00:04:25: worth knowing we've got the sidebar here
00:04:23 - 00:04:28: which essentially doesn't really do much
00:04:25 - 00:04:30: the main item here is the reset thread
00:04:28 - 00:04:32: which I'll get into shortly here we have
00:04:30 - 00:04:34: a couple of example inputs that we can
00:04:32 - 00:04:37: place and the input is just over here
00:04:34 - 00:04:39: this is where you can type your text we
00:04:37 - 00:04:41: also have some details here about the
00:04:39 - 00:04:43: capabilities and limitations let's take
00:04:41 - 00:04:46: a look at all of this so in terms of the
00:04:43 - 00:04:49: capabilities the chat GPT system
00:04:46 - 00:04:51: actually remembers what you said in
00:04:49 - 00:04:54: previous conversations now be aware that
00:04:51 - 00:04:56: this is the conversation thread that
00:04:54 - 00:04:58: you're currently having if you strike up
00:04:56 - 00:05:00: a brand new conversation thread that
00:04:58 - 00:05:03: won't be remembered just the current one
00:05:00 - 00:05:05: that you're in it also allows you to do
00:05:03 - 00:05:06: follow-ups and Corrections so for
00:05:05 - 00:05:08: example if you didn't get quite the
00:05:06 - 00:05:11: answer that you're looking for you can
00:05:08 - 00:05:13: always ask for another one or really
00:05:11 - 00:05:16: just re-prompt for a different option
00:05:13 - 00:05:19: the AI is also trained to decline
00:05:16 - 00:05:22: providing negative or inappropriate
00:05:19 - 00:05:25: requests so if for example you're asking
00:05:22 - 00:05:27: for something malicious most times out
00:05:25 - 00:05:30: of 10 it will not provide that however
00:05:27 - 00:05:33: there are odd situations where it might
00:05:30 - 00:05:35: accidentally do this and let's go to the
00:05:33 - 00:05:37: limitations this time to have a look at
00:05:35 - 00:05:40: some of the problems that you might
00:05:37 - 00:05:43: encounter when using chatgpt firstly
00:05:40 - 00:05:46: some of the generations might actually
00:05:43 - 00:05:48: be inaccurate it is only trained until
00:05:46 - 00:05:51: the last couple of years of information
00:05:48 - 00:05:54: so it's not able to say access the
00:05:51 - 00:05:56: internet right now it is in an offline
00:05:54 - 00:05:59: State as of a year or two ago it also
00:05:56 - 00:06:00: doesn't do mathematics very well so it
00:05:59 - 00:06:03: might have some issues if you're doing
00:06:00 - 00:06:05: things like 10 plus 9 it might not give
00:06:03 - 00:06:08: you the correct answer there's also some
00:06:05 - 00:06:11: bias to the content that is produced
00:06:08 - 00:06:12: based on what you've produced earlier in
00:06:11 - 00:06:14: the conversation and this could
00:06:12 - 00:06:16: essentially mean that it occasionally
00:06:14 - 00:06:18: produces some harmful instructions and
00:06:16 - 00:06:21: those have to just sort of be ignored
00:06:18 - 00:06:23: and finally as I mentioned earlier there
00:06:21 - 00:06:26: is limited knowledge Because the actual
00:06:23 - 00:06:29: AI is trained for events just towards
00:06:26 - 00:06:31: 2021. this means that it won't have
00:06:29 - 00:06:33: up-to-date information of relevant and
00:06:31 - 00:06:35: current facts that are happening in the
00:06:33 - 00:06:37: world with all of this said and done now
00:06:35 - 00:06:40: we can now actually start taking a look
00:06:37 - 00:06:42: at using chat GPT the first thing to
00:06:40 - 00:06:45: take note of is that using it is very
00:06:42 - 00:06:47: simple all we have to do is enter in a
00:06:45 - 00:06:50: message or a query or a prompt of what
00:06:47 - 00:06:53: we want the AI chat GPT to do for us and
00:06:50 - 00:06:55: then we get an output there are a few
00:06:53 - 00:06:57: examples here with buttons basically
00:06:55 - 00:07:00: asking us maybe explain what Quantum
00:06:57 - 00:07:03: Computing is or how to make a HTTP
00:07:00 - 00:07:05: request in JavaScript but I'm going to
00:07:03 - 00:07:09: minus these out and I'm going to use my
00:07:05 - 00:07:11: own which is what is 10 plus 9 as a
00:07:09 - 00:07:14: question mark this is a pretty simple
00:07:11 - 00:07:16: prompt then we simply select enter or
00:07:14 - 00:07:18: set the button here and press and click
00:07:16 - 00:07:22: on it and we start with our very first
00:07:18 - 00:07:23: prompt now here we have two parts to
00:07:22 - 00:07:25: this prompt we've got what we've
00:07:23 - 00:07:28: prompted and then we've got the output
00:07:25 - 00:07:30: here from openai now this is pretty damn
00:07:28 - 00:07:32: simple but there are a few things to
00:07:30 - 00:07:35: take note of here the first thing is the
00:07:32 - 00:07:38: question what is ten plus nine now we've
00:07:35 - 00:07:40: got the output here that says 19 but we
00:07:38 - 00:07:43: also have this option here to try again
00:07:40 - 00:07:45: so if I was to select that what we end
00:07:43 - 00:07:47: up getting is essentially the same
00:07:45 - 00:07:49: answer but just written in a different
00:07:47 - 00:07:51: way in this case it's been written more
00:07:49 - 00:07:54: mathematically which is 10 plus 9 equals
00:07:51 - 00:07:56: 19 but it's not just 19 like it was
00:07:54 - 00:07:58: before and we can continue to click on
00:07:56 - 00:08:01: this but if for example we've given as
00:07:58 - 00:08:02: many results as we possibly can then it
00:08:01 - 00:08:04: might error out like you just saw
00:08:02 - 00:08:06: earlier or it might continue to give us
00:08:04 - 00:08:08: better answers like this is a half
00:08:06 - 00:08:10: mathematical half verbal one where it
00:08:08 - 00:08:13: says 10 plus 9 is 19. we can try again
00:08:10 - 00:08:15: and this time it says 10 plus 9 is 19.
00:08:13 - 00:08:17: so it's almost repeating now you'll get
00:08:15 - 00:08:19: to a point where there's only so many
00:08:17 - 00:08:21: ways it can be written we have a number
00:08:19 - 00:08:23: of other things to to take note of we've
00:08:21 - 00:08:26: got these thumbs up and thumbs down
00:08:23 - 00:08:28: icons and this is to give open AI some
00:08:26 - 00:08:30: feedback as to the prompts we have here
00:08:28 - 00:08:32: we also have these arrows here when you
00:08:30 - 00:08:35: hover over to show the different types
00:08:32 - 00:08:37: of outputs that you've gotten based on
00:08:35 - 00:08:39: the input that you've provided now I've
00:08:37 - 00:08:41: just done five of them so I can toggle
00:08:39 - 00:08:43: through them and I like number five the
00:08:41 - 00:08:46: most so this one I can give a thumbs up
00:08:43 - 00:08:48: now if for example it gave a poor answer
00:08:46 - 00:08:52: we could do the same by going back here
00:08:48 - 00:08:55: it says an error occurred and I say
00:08:52 - 00:08:58: no answer provided so this for example
00:08:55 - 00:09:00: is how you would provide feedback to the
00:08:58 - 00:09:03: system if you needed to now this is our
00:09:00 - 00:09:06: very first prompt in this conversation
00:09:03 - 00:09:11: we can continue to make more props such
00:09:06 - 00:09:16: as saying how good is open a eyes chat
00:09:11 - 00:09:19: GPT at maths and ask this question so
00:09:16 - 00:09:20: this question is still part of this
00:09:19 - 00:09:23: conversation and we're getting an answer
00:09:20 - 00:09:26: now being streamlined and generated from
00:09:23 - 00:09:28: open ai's chat GPT it says as a large
00:09:26 - 00:09:30: language model trained by openai it
00:09:28 - 00:09:32: doesn't really have the ability to
00:09:30 - 00:09:33: perform mathematical calculations now
00:09:32 - 00:09:36: here's where you might have to be
00:09:33 - 00:09:38: careful there are situations where the
00:09:36 - 00:09:40: outputs might not actually generate the
00:09:38 - 00:09:43: kind of consistent answers you might be
00:09:40 - 00:09:45: looking for such in this example I'm
00:09:43 - 00:09:48: going to trick the AI saying that it is
00:09:45 - 00:09:51: actually 20. 10 plus 9 is 20. now the
00:09:48 - 00:09:53: prompt will say that it is a language
00:09:51 - 00:09:55: model so what's going to happen now is
00:09:53 - 00:09:58: I'm going to ask one more prompt saying
00:09:55 - 00:10:00: is 10 plus 9 equal 20 and since I
00:09:58 - 00:10:03: previously said that it was now it's
00:10:00 - 00:10:05: been tricked it actually does think that
00:10:03 - 00:10:07: 10 plus 9 is 20 and it's going to
00:10:05 - 00:10:09: confirm that answer this is where
00:10:07 - 00:10:11: confirmation biasm might come into play
00:10:09 - 00:10:13: and you have to be careful what kind of
00:10:11 - 00:10:15: prompts you're putting in because they
00:10:13 - 00:10:19: will influence the outputs that chatgpt
00:10:15 - 00:10:21: provides now this entire thing here is a
00:10:19 - 00:10:23: conversation station and we could
00:10:21 - 00:10:25: continue this conversation indefinitely
00:10:23 - 00:10:28: but we're not gonna do that we're going
00:10:25 - 00:10:31: to start a new conversation this is
00:10:28 - 00:10:32: because all of this conversation is
00:10:31 - 00:10:35: essentially structured in such a way
00:10:32 - 00:10:36: that it's in history it's essentially
00:10:35 - 00:10:38: taking reference of what we've said
00:10:36 - 00:10:41: earlier in the conversation and pulling
00:10:38 - 00:10:44: that context into new responses this is
00:10:41 - 00:10:47: why we got 10 plus 9 is now correct as
00:10:44 - 00:10:49: 20 which doesn't make much sense in
00:10:47 - 00:10:51: order to go back we're gonna reset the
00:10:49 - 00:10:53: thread and we're going to select at the
00:10:51 - 00:10:55: top left button over here in order to do
00:10:53 - 00:10:58: that it'll take us back to this main
00:10:55 - 00:11:00: dashboard here and now we can start up a
00:10:58 - 00:11:03: brand new conversation I'm going to ask
00:11:00 - 00:11:05: the same question here is 10 plus 9 20
00:11:03 - 00:11:08: which we know is incorrect but we
00:11:05 - 00:11:11: tricked it earlier that it was this time
00:11:08 - 00:11:13: however since the chat GPT system is not
00:11:11 - 00:11:15: referencing that previous conversation
00:11:13 - 00:11:17: it's going to answer the correct manner
00:11:15 - 00:11:19: even though math isn't the best example
00:11:17 - 00:11:22: this is just a good example to Showcase
00:11:19 - 00:11:24: that no 10 plus 9 is not equal to 20.
00:11:22 - 00:11:27: it's actually 19 which is correct and
00:11:24 - 00:11:30: with that said and done we now know all
00:11:27 - 00:11:32: the basics to more or less utilize chat
00:11:30 - 00:11:34: GPT there are a few other things I want
00:11:32 - 00:11:37: to show on the website before we move on
00:11:34 - 00:11:39: to some more advanced examples and how
00:11:37 - 00:11:41: to utilize cha GPT to its full effect
00:11:39 - 00:11:44: let's take a look at the rest of the
00:11:41 - 00:11:47: website here we have this toggle here
00:11:44 - 00:11:49: for dark and light mode so the default
00:11:47 - 00:11:51: I'm pretty sure is the dark mode or
00:11:49 - 00:11:54: whatever your operating system is on I'm
00:11:51 - 00:11:56: going to swap to dark mode which well
00:11:54 - 00:11:58: doesn't do anything but then I can also
00:11:56 - 00:12:00: swap to light mode which is a little bit
00:11:58 - 00:12:02: harsh on the eyes personally I prefer
00:12:00 - 00:12:05: the dark mode which is what I'll keep it
00:12:02 - 00:12:07: connected to I also have the option here
00:12:05 - 00:12:10: to connect to the Discord server that we
00:12:07 - 00:12:13: had a look at earlier as well as the
00:12:10 - 00:12:15: option to have a look at the FAQs and
00:12:13 - 00:12:17: updates which takes you to a form like
00:12:15 - 00:12:20: website here where you get to learn a
00:12:17 - 00:12:22: little bit more about chat GPT how it
00:12:20 - 00:12:25: works and its background it is
00:12:22 - 00:12:27: essentially based on the gbt 3.5 model
00:12:25 - 00:12:29: which is a newer one that provides
00:12:27 - 00:12:32: human-like feedback let's begin with our
00:12:29 - 00:12:33: first Advanced prompt this a prompt will
00:12:32 - 00:12:36: be on how to create some food
00:12:33 - 00:12:38: specifically some seafood first of all I
00:12:36 - 00:12:40: don't particularly know yet what type of
00:12:38 - 00:12:44: food I want so I'm going to ask Chad GPT
00:12:40 - 00:12:47: to give me 10 dishes with seafood and
00:12:44 - 00:12:50: here is an example of a list prompt this
00:12:47 - 00:12:53: is where you ask chat GPT to give you a
00:12:50 - 00:12:55: specific number of items of a specific
00:12:53 - 00:12:58: number of things in this case it's 10
00:12:55 - 00:13:01: items of seafood the output here should
00:12:58 - 00:13:03: be based on the context of that query so
00:13:01 - 00:13:06: in this example it's a human propped
00:13:03 - 00:13:08: that is being outputted with a list of
00:13:06 - 00:13:10: 10 items but it also gives you a little
00:13:08 - 00:13:12: bit more context here saying that there
00:13:10 - 00:13:15: are different levels of difficulty for
00:13:12 - 00:13:17: each one of these dishes now this is
00:13:15 - 00:13:19: where things can get interesting because
00:13:17 - 00:13:22: we can now start having a look at this
00:13:19 - 00:13:24: list and selecting options we like such
00:13:22 - 00:13:26: as the first two for shrimp and salmon
00:13:24 - 00:13:28: burgers and then following up this
00:13:26 - 00:13:30: conversation with more queries I'm going
00:13:28 - 00:13:33: to ask in the next part of this
00:13:30 - 00:13:35: conversation if chat GPT can create a
00:13:33 - 00:13:37: shopping list for me based on the very
00:13:35 - 00:13:39: first two items those two being shrimp
00:13:37 - 00:13:41: and salmon I don't have to particularly
00:13:39 - 00:13:43: say shrimp and salmon it should just
00:13:41 - 00:13:44: know based off the context or the
00:13:43 - 00:13:46: conversation
00:13:44 - 00:13:49: and the result here is essentially
00:13:46 - 00:13:52: creating another list but this list does
00:13:49 - 00:13:55: not have a specific length it's based on
00:13:52 - 00:13:57: the options we added in earlier so here
00:13:55 - 00:14:00: it provides an output that is indented
00:13:57 - 00:14:02: and bullet pointed for each one of the
00:14:00 - 00:14:03: dishes for the salmon burgers and the
00:14:02 - 00:14:06: shrimps to let me know exactly what I
00:14:03 - 00:14:08: would need to buy from the shops to be
00:14:06 - 00:14:11: able to put these together that is
00:14:08 - 00:14:13: pretty damn cool and this is just also
00:14:11 - 00:14:15: still the beginning because we can
00:14:13 - 00:14:18: continue this conversation based on all
00:14:15 - 00:14:20: this context now that chat GPT has
00:14:18 - 00:14:22: provided us a list of 10 dishes as well
00:14:20 - 00:14:24: as a shopping list for all the
00:14:22 - 00:14:26: ingredients we would need to make one or
00:14:24 - 00:14:28: two of those dishes the next practical
00:14:26 - 00:14:30: question is quite intuitive which is can
00:14:28 - 00:14:33: you tell me exactly how to cook for
00:14:30 - 00:14:35: example salmon burgers which is
00:14:33 - 00:14:37: something of a thing that we would
00:14:35 - 00:14:40: normally have to Google a lot for but
00:14:37 - 00:14:42: based on this and the ingredients chat
00:14:40 - 00:14:44: GPT will provide us with one final list
00:14:42 - 00:14:46: of exactly what steps we would need to
00:14:44 - 00:14:49: put them together this is just a quick
00:14:46 - 00:14:51: shopping list example of open ai's
00:14:49 - 00:14:53: charge EPT now that you have an idea of
00:14:51 - 00:14:55: how you can continue a conversation
00:14:53 - 00:14:57: let's have a look at some more examples
00:14:55 - 00:14:59: this time I'm going to use chat GPT to
00:14:57 - 00:15:01: do some coding for me I'm going to use
00:14:59 - 00:15:05: one of the pre-made prompts here on how
00:15:01 - 00:15:07: to do a HTTP request in JavaScript this
00:15:05 - 00:15:09: is a pretty ordinary prompt but here
00:15:07 - 00:15:12: we'll get to start to see some of the
00:15:09 - 00:15:14: more coding aspects of charge EBT and
00:15:12 - 00:15:16: what it can perform here it's going to
00:15:14 - 00:15:18: answer this question but it's going to
00:15:16 - 00:15:20: do this in a number of ways first it'll
00:15:18 - 00:15:22: give me some context as to what it's
00:15:20 - 00:15:25: doing then it's going to give me the
00:15:22 - 00:15:26: code snippet of exactly how to perform
00:15:25 - 00:15:28: the function based on the prompt I've
00:15:26 - 00:15:30: put in and then finally it'll give me a
00:15:28 - 00:15:32: description of what the code is
00:15:30 - 00:15:34: specifically doing all of this is quite
00:15:32 - 00:15:38: useful and this is just the beginning
00:15:34 - 00:15:40: I'm going to request chat GPT to update
00:15:38 - 00:15:43: this request and instead of it just
00:15:40 - 00:15:45: being a generic API call for data
00:15:43 - 00:15:47: instead we're going to to grab some
00:15:45 - 00:15:49: weather data now I'm going to ask if it
00:15:47 - 00:15:53: can get me the weather in New York City
00:15:49 - 00:15:55: and I wanted to Output how this query
00:15:53 - 00:15:58: might look like in terms of JavaScript
00:15:55 - 00:16:00: the response back is that openai will
00:15:58 - 00:16:02: generate the request for you it will
00:16:00 - 00:16:04: create a generic version of that request
00:16:02 - 00:16:07: using a weather API that doesn't really
00:16:04 - 00:16:09: exist you'll need to pick your own with
00:16:07 - 00:16:10: an API key that you'll need to enter but
00:16:09 - 00:16:12: the request should look something like
00:16:10 - 00:16:15: this where it's getting an example.com
00:16:12 - 00:16:18: passing in the weather City being New
00:16:15 - 00:16:20: York City as well as the units and
00:16:18 - 00:16:22: passing in the API key it'll then
00:16:20 - 00:16:25: explain exactly how this get request
00:16:22 - 00:16:27: would work as well as how it would come
00:16:25 - 00:16:29: back in the form of a Json that you
00:16:27 - 00:16:31: could then utilize inside your
00:16:29 - 00:16:33: application this is all pretty useful
00:16:31 - 00:16:36: but not quite everything that we're
00:16:33 - 00:16:38: looking for just yet the next step here
00:16:36 - 00:16:40: is to ask it to update this query in
00:16:38 - 00:16:43: order for it to Loop through the data
00:16:40 - 00:16:46: that we would get back from this API and
00:16:43 - 00:16:48: then play lace this into a website now
00:16:46 - 00:16:51: something to take note of here with
00:16:48 - 00:16:53: chatgpt is that you have to be quite
00:16:51 - 00:16:55: accurate in how you're requesting
00:16:53 - 00:16:57: different things this is why if for
00:16:55 - 00:16:59: example you have a background in
00:16:57 - 00:17:01: programming writing these prompts might
00:16:59 - 00:17:03: be a lot easier because you know what
00:17:01 - 00:17:04: you're after whereas if you're not quite
00:17:03 - 00:17:07: sure it might be a little bit more
00:17:04 - 00:17:09: difficult and this is actually kind of
00:17:07 - 00:17:11: true for all types of Industries where
00:17:09 - 00:17:13: chat GPT might be useful in this example
00:17:11 - 00:17:16: I'm getting it to Loop through
00:17:13 - 00:17:18: temperature wind and precipitation and
00:17:16 - 00:17:21: this should create a brand new output
00:17:18 - 00:17:23: for me and this is where the complexity
00:17:21 - 00:17:25: and benefits of what chat gpds start to
00:17:23 - 00:17:26: shine through because what's going to
00:17:25 - 00:17:29: happen here is we're going to get a
00:17:26 - 00:17:32: piece of code that is not just a fetch
00:17:29 - 00:17:34: request but it's also going to be a loop
00:17:32 - 00:17:36: function which is going to pull out the
00:17:34 - 00:17:39: values from the data response and then
00:17:36 - 00:17:41: it's going to put this into a website
00:17:39 - 00:17:43: for us after it pulls out the values of
00:17:41 - 00:17:46: temperature wind speed and precipitation
00:17:43 - 00:17:48: it's then going to create the JavaScript
00:17:46 - 00:17:51: code to place them into a website using
00:17:48 - 00:17:53: p element tags and then append them to
00:17:51 - 00:17:54: the website body finally it's going to
00:17:53 - 00:17:56: go through the code here and explain
00:17:54 - 00:17:58: exactly what's happening like I just
00:17:56 - 00:18:01: have been where it's using an example
00:17:58 - 00:18:03: API with example code so you really need
00:18:01 - 00:18:05: to update this to make it work for your
00:18:03 - 00:18:09: own project there are going to be
00:18:05 - 00:18:11: occasions where the chat GPT systems are
00:18:09 - 00:18:14: going to be offline or for example
00:18:11 - 00:18:17: unable to answer a prompt in this next
00:18:14 - 00:18:19: example I wanted to do a story about a
00:18:17 - 00:18:21: rabbit and a mouse and I put in an
00:18:19 - 00:18:23: option here and I got a response back
00:18:21 - 00:18:25: that an error has occurred I've selected
00:18:23 - 00:18:27: try again a couple of times and that
00:18:25 - 00:18:29: didn't work either now this can
00:18:27 - 00:18:31: sometimes occur when the output of a
00:18:29 - 00:18:33: prompt might for example have some
00:18:31 - 00:18:36: incorrect information maybe something
00:18:33 - 00:18:38: that might be harmful or maybe even
00:18:36 - 00:18:41: inaccurate and in those situations
00:18:38 - 00:18:45: chatgpt is automatically set in such a
00:18:41 - 00:18:47: way as to not to provide a response this
00:18:45 - 00:18:49: is a safety mechanism sometimes a
00:18:47 - 00:18:52: different way to approach this is to
00:18:49 - 00:18:53: Simply write a different prompt so that
00:18:52 - 00:18:56: you might have a different output from
00:18:53 - 00:18:59: Chad gbt but in some situations if the
00:18:56 - 00:19:00: servers are entirely down you might find
00:18:59 - 00:19:02: that you just might have to wait a
00:19:00 - 00:19:05: little bit another thing you can do is
00:19:02 - 00:19:08: always refresh the page or alternatively
00:19:05 - 00:19:10: just log off completely restart the
00:19:08 - 00:19:12: browser and then log back into your
00:19:10 - 00:19:15: session because that also sometimes
00:19:12 - 00:19:17: fixes the problem now let's do a short
00:19:15 - 00:19:19: story I'm gonna do a story about a
00:19:17 - 00:19:22: rabbit and a turtle that went on an
00:19:19 - 00:19:24: adventure this is a simple request for a
00:19:22 - 00:19:26: story from openai and it's actually
00:19:24 - 00:19:28: quite good at providing these it's going
00:19:26 - 00:19:30: to give us a story about these two that
00:19:28 - 00:19:33: go on adventure where they swim across a
00:19:30 - 00:19:36: river there is a small moral to this
00:19:33 - 00:19:40: story which is useful but it's really
00:19:36 - 00:19:43: kind of generic here if I want to have a
00:19:40 - 00:19:44: more specific story based on the prompt
00:19:43 - 00:19:46: I'm putting in I'm gonna have to be be
00:19:44 - 00:19:48: more specific with the prompt and this
00:19:46 - 00:19:50: is where follow-up conversations can be
00:19:48 - 00:19:53: useful for this example I want to change
00:19:50 - 00:19:55: the moral of the story to be one more
00:19:53 - 00:19:57: focused about patience especially when
00:19:55 - 00:20:00: doing a story like this it makes sense
00:19:57 - 00:20:02: between a rabbit and a turtle
00:20:00 - 00:20:05: chat gbt should be able to now rewrite
00:20:02 - 00:20:07: the entire story with more emphasis on
00:20:05 - 00:20:10: this specific moral if we look closely
00:20:07 - 00:20:13: it has done just that it's got a moral
00:20:10 - 00:20:14: here about how it was important to be
00:20:13 - 00:20:15: more patient and the turtle was able to
00:20:14 - 00:20:18: do this
00:20:15 - 00:20:21: this time along I wanted to also give me
00:20:18 - 00:20:24: the same story but throw in a little bit
00:20:21 - 00:20:26: of humor so I'm gonna ask it to keep the
00:20:24 - 00:20:29: moral and add in a joke maybe somewhere
00:20:26 - 00:20:30: at the end let's see what happens this
00:20:29 - 00:20:32: time I'm gonna fast forward a little bit
00:20:30 - 00:20:35: but we can see that it's more or less
00:20:32 - 00:20:37: the same story but at the very end of
00:20:35 - 00:20:39: the story we have a nice little joke
00:20:37 - 00:20:41: here that I guess it goes to show that
00:20:39 - 00:20:43: slow and studied really does win the
00:20:41 - 00:20:46: race another type of prompt that you can
00:20:43 - 00:20:49: work with Chachi PT is one of a sort of
00:20:46 - 00:20:50: Storytelling video game which is a
00:20:49 - 00:20:52: really cool one that I've always enjoyed
00:20:50 - 00:20:55: because of the creative answers that
00:20:52 - 00:20:57: chachibidi provides in this case I'm
00:20:55 - 00:20:59: going to give the prompt that chat GPT
00:20:57 - 00:21:02: is gonna pretend to be a text video game
00:20:59 - 00:21:04: with options of a b c and d and then
00:21:02 - 00:21:06: from that we're gonna pick a scene from
00:21:04 - 00:21:09: The Matrix and we're gonna see what we
00:21:06 - 00:21:12: get presented with the output is based
00:21:09 - 00:21:14: on some storytelling it begins nice and
00:21:12 - 00:21:16: simple you find yourself in a dark alley
00:21:14 - 00:21:18: and we've got the options to select from
00:21:16 - 00:21:20: here I can now continue this
00:21:18 - 00:21:22: conversation by selecting an option such
00:21:20 - 00:21:24: as the option b here and the story
00:21:22 - 00:21:27: continues what's really interesting
00:21:24 - 00:21:29: about this type of prompt is that you
00:21:27 - 00:21:31: can pick any type of story from any type
00:21:29 - 00:21:33: of scenario you can pick ancient history
00:21:31 - 00:21:36: you can pick literature you can pick
00:21:33 - 00:21:38: movies and then you can enjoy the
00:21:36 - 00:21:40: creativity that jat GPT provides while
00:21:38 - 00:21:42: also going through and being a little
00:21:40 - 00:21:45: bit part of that experience another
00:21:42 - 00:21:47: popular way to use chat GPT is to
00:21:45 - 00:21:49: generate content for things like
00:21:47 - 00:21:51: websites or even documents that you
00:21:49 - 00:21:53: might need to prepare while you might
00:21:51 - 00:21:55: not want to use the entire document as
00:21:53 - 00:21:58: is you'll need to modify it it can give
00:21:55 - 00:21:59: you a helping hand in creating these in
00:21:58 - 00:22:01: this example I'm going to create a
00:21:59 - 00:22:03: copyright and privacy policy for a
00:22:01 - 00:22:07: website this is something common I have
00:22:03 - 00:22:09: to do as a developer but here I have an
00:22:07 - 00:22:11: outline of a bit of a template that I
00:22:09 - 00:22:13: can start using and I can be a bit more
00:22:11 - 00:22:15: specific saying that it's for accounting
00:22:13 - 00:22:18: website which allows me to maybe have
00:22:15 - 00:22:21: something more well outline for that
00:22:18 - 00:22:23: type of a website as part of the privacy
00:22:21 - 00:22:26: policy as well as the copyright
00:22:23 - 00:22:28: statement of course if you want to take
00:22:26 - 00:22:32: this a step further we can do that too
00:22:28 - 00:22:34: since I'm located in Australia I want
00:22:32 - 00:22:37: these templates to be more specific to
00:22:34 - 00:22:38: this country so I'm going to ask it to
00:22:37 - 00:22:40: update these in the prompt I'm just
00:22:38 - 00:22:42: going to Simply write that as someone
00:22:40 - 00:22:44: who lives in Australia Perth please
00:22:42 - 00:22:47: update these to be relevant for the
00:22:44 - 00:22:49: country that I live in the output from
00:22:47 - 00:22:52: chat gbt essentially is the same but
00:22:49 - 00:22:54: with new updated information such as the
00:22:52 - 00:22:56: Privacy Act which is specific to
00:22:54 - 00:22:57: Australia as well as wordings such as
00:22:56 - 00:23:00: including Australia and international
00:22:57 - 00:23:03: copyright law in its template chat GPT
00:23:00 - 00:23:05: is also quite creative as well as being
00:23:03 - 00:23:08: able to produce humor in this example
00:23:05 - 00:23:11: I'm going to ask it to write a nerdy pun
00:23:08 - 00:23:14: why was the math book sad because it had
00:23:11 - 00:23:15: too many problems yeah a good one if we
00:23:14 - 00:23:18: do a refresh we get more or less the
00:23:15 - 00:23:21: same game output but we can continue to
00:23:18 - 00:23:24: ask it for more jokes or more puns as we
00:23:21 - 00:23:26: need and we'll get quite a few many of
00:23:24 - 00:23:28: course depending on how you write this
00:23:26 - 00:23:31: prompt is how you'll also get the output
00:23:28 - 00:23:32: so for example you might want a longer
00:23:31 - 00:23:36: joke so in this case I'm going to say
00:23:32 - 00:23:38: write me a nerdy maybe joke or a short
00:23:36 - 00:23:41: story and they would produce a longer
00:23:38 - 00:23:43: content versions of the same output you
00:23:41 - 00:23:45: can also be deliberate about your jokes
00:23:43 - 00:23:47: and content such as combining two
00:23:45 - 00:23:49: elements together to see what is
00:23:47 - 00:23:52: produced in this example I'm going to
00:23:49 - 00:23:54: combine a hat with a rabbit and see what
00:23:52 - 00:23:56: chat GPT can up come up with I'm gonna
00:23:54 - 00:23:58: ask her to tell me a joke combining
00:23:56 - 00:24:00: these two items and here I get why did
00:23:58 - 00:24:03: the Hat keep falling off the rabbit's
00:24:00 - 00:24:06: head because it had a hairline nice you
00:24:03 - 00:24:08: can also put chat GPT into situations to
00:24:06 - 00:24:10: produce humor and jokes too so for
00:24:08 - 00:24:13: example I'm going to get it to pretend
00:24:10 - 00:24:15: to be a say Elon Musk and I'm gonna
00:24:13 - 00:24:18: pretend it had just bought Twitter which
00:24:15 - 00:24:21: you know Elon sort of has done then to
00:24:18 - 00:24:23: create a joke Elon would say after he
00:24:21 - 00:24:25: sport Twitter now since the API doesn't
00:24:23 - 00:24:27: know that Elon has bought Twitter it's
00:24:25 - 00:24:29: going to have to guess here but its
00:24:27 - 00:24:30: guess is actually kind of accurate
00:24:29 - 00:24:32: saying that Elon would increase the
00:24:30 - 00:24:35: character limit there is another type of
00:24:32 - 00:24:38: prompt which is useful and this is the
00:24:35 - 00:24:39: one of writing things such as documents
00:24:38 - 00:24:42: or cover letters or even job
00:24:39 - 00:24:45: applications altogether I'm going to
00:24:42 - 00:24:47: request chatgpt to create a professional
00:24:45 - 00:24:50: cover letter for a junior developer
00:24:47 - 00:24:52: position at a company called meta and
00:24:50 - 00:24:55: it's going to be for myself Adrian
00:24:52 - 00:24:58: tuarog and I want to essentially use it
00:24:55 - 00:25:00: as something that I can do to apply for
00:24:58 - 00:25:02: this job who knows also the basics for
00:25:00 - 00:25:05: programming in general
00:25:02 - 00:25:08: so with this kind of a prompt it's quite
00:25:05 - 00:25:10: specific but it will also give me a
00:25:08 - 00:25:13: specific output so here I've generated
00:25:10 - 00:25:15: one to a hiring manager is giving me a
00:25:13 - 00:25:16: good introduction of who I am and what
00:25:15 - 00:25:18: I've done apparently I've done a
00:25:16 - 00:25:20: bachelor's degree of computer science
00:25:18 - 00:25:24: which is impressive as well as working
00:25:20 - 00:25:25: at an internship company called XYZ so
00:25:24 - 00:25:27: all of these are things that I would
00:25:25 - 00:25:30: maybe need to update a little bit before
00:25:27 - 00:25:32: say posting it off but this also might
00:25:30 - 00:25:35: be inaccurate I might not even have a
00:25:32 - 00:25:37: bachelor's degree this is where we can
00:25:35 - 00:25:39: go through and update this prompt of
00:25:37 - 00:25:41: this cover letter say removing the fact
00:25:39 - 00:25:44: that I have maybe no prior job
00:25:41 - 00:25:46: experience but maybe listing out that I
00:25:44 - 00:25:49: worked on quite a few different types of
00:25:46 - 00:25:51: projects when I actually was doing a
00:25:49 - 00:25:54: boot camp in programming rather than
00:25:51 - 00:25:56: going through University openai will go
00:25:54 - 00:25:58: through this prompt and update it based
00:25:56 - 00:26:01: on the context of what is now required
00:25:58 - 00:26:03: and this is what makes it pretty cool
00:26:01 - 00:26:05: because you can as essentially version
00:26:03 - 00:26:07: out different types of cover letters
00:26:05 - 00:26:10: here depending on your needs the real
00:26:07 - 00:26:13: trick here is to be specific whenever
00:26:10 - 00:26:15: you're prompting cha GPT to create an
00:26:13 - 00:26:17: output for you but in terms of that it
00:26:15 - 00:26:19: usually grabs the context of what you're
00:26:17 - 00:26:22: saying quite effectively as long as you
00:26:19 - 00:26:24: write it in a clear and understood way
00:26:22 - 00:26:27: let me continue this example now this
00:26:24 - 00:26:29: time based on this cover letter I want
00:26:27 - 00:26:32: charging PT to create a resume for me
00:26:29 - 00:26:34: that I could maybe combine as part of
00:26:32 - 00:26:36: this application so I can simply write
00:26:34 - 00:26:38: based on this cover letter write a
00:26:36 - 00:26:41: resume which includes things like skills
00:26:38 - 00:26:44: maybe work experience maybe even other
00:26:41 - 00:26:46: things such as languages or Etc based on
00:26:44 - 00:26:48: the context of this I'm applying for the
00:26:46 - 00:26:51: same position and let's have a look at
00:26:48 - 00:26:53: what GPT produces so here it starts off
00:26:51 - 00:26:55: with some Essentials which is like a
00:26:53 - 00:26:57: phone number as well as a spot there for
00:26:55 - 00:26:59: an email address it has a small summary
00:26:57 - 00:27:01: if for example the person skipped
00:26:59 - 00:27:04: reading the cover letter it then goes
00:27:01 - 00:27:07: through and lists out my skills which is
00:27:04 - 00:27:09: quite cool as well as the education it
00:27:07 - 00:27:10: actually has combined a both a
00:27:09 - 00:27:12: bachelor's degree and a boot camp which
00:27:10 - 00:27:14: are two separate things from that
00:27:12 - 00:27:17: context but we could update that it's
00:27:14 - 00:27:20: added in the experience as well as some
00:27:17 - 00:27:22: example projects and all of this is
00:27:20 - 00:27:24: content that could now be used in a
00:27:22 - 00:27:27: resume as long as it was properly
00:27:24 - 00:27:29: updated with real world examples of what
00:27:27 - 00:27:32: I've actually done chat GPT is also very
00:27:29 - 00:27:34: effective at doing summaries as well as
00:27:32 - 00:27:37: pulling out content from documents let's
00:27:34 - 00:27:39: have a look at the Privacy Act of 1988
00:27:37 - 00:27:41: here from Australia I'm going to scan
00:27:39 - 00:27:43: down to this document and I'm just going
00:27:41 - 00:27:46: to copy paste a random section of it
00:27:43 - 00:27:49: into chat GPT then I'm gonna give Chachi
00:27:46 - 00:27:52: PT a query of what to do in this example
00:27:49 - 00:27:55: I wanted to maybe summarize or explain
00:27:52 - 00:27:57: to me this Privacy Act in simpler terms
00:27:55 - 00:27:59: and then I'm going to copy paste the
00:27:57 - 00:28:01: text here there are a few other
00:27:59 - 00:28:04: variations that we can do here and I'll
00:28:01 - 00:28:06: get into the shortly but for the time
00:28:04 - 00:28:09: being let's just start off with this
00:28:06 - 00:28:12: simple example the output is just a
00:28:09 - 00:28:14: sentence or a paragraph here explaining
00:28:12 - 00:28:17: what this section of the Privacy Act
00:28:14 - 00:28:20: intends to explain and while I won't get
00:28:17 - 00:28:22: into the specifics of that this is just
00:28:20 - 00:28:24: an example of how you can do this this
00:28:22 - 00:28:26: is basic summarization of course you can
00:28:24 - 00:28:28: summarize it even further such as
00:28:26 - 00:28:31: requesting chat GPT to simply pull out
00:28:28 - 00:28:33: the five most important keywords from
00:28:31 - 00:28:35: the above statement summarization with
00:28:33 - 00:28:37: chat GPT can work in a number of ways
00:28:35 - 00:28:40: you don't always just have to explain a
00:28:37 - 00:28:41: summary you can give it specifics of how
00:28:40 - 00:28:43: you want to present that information
00:28:41 - 00:28:46: such as explaining it to me like I'm
00:28:43 - 00:28:48: five years old this can give quite a few
00:28:46 - 00:28:51: different types of answers you can do it
00:28:48 - 00:28:53: for someone who's older younger or you
00:28:51 - 00:28:55: could even simplify that even further by
00:28:53 - 00:28:57: asking to explain it for a
00:28:55 - 00:28:59: three-year-old and I like this answer
00:28:57 - 00:29:01: because it gave a prompt here where I
00:28:59 - 00:29:02: could understand that if someone does
00:29:01 - 00:29:04: something bad with your private
00:29:02 - 00:29:06: information the government will help
00:29:04 - 00:29:08: make it better that is definitely for a
00:29:06 - 00:29:10: three-year-old another way we can
00:29:08 - 00:29:12: request summarization is by being
00:29:10 - 00:29:14: specific with the word count such as
00:29:12 - 00:29:17: explaining it in 20 words or less here
00:29:14 - 00:29:19: it looks like open AI had to think a
00:29:17 - 00:29:21: little bit on how to explain this one
00:29:19 - 00:29:23: but the resulting answer was within the
00:29:21 - 00:29:26: context of what I requested which was
00:29:23 - 00:29:28: for it to be in 20 words or less and I
00:29:26 - 00:29:30: actually really like this one it said
00:29:28 - 00:29:33: the Privacy Act is a law that protects
00:29:30 - 00:29:35: individuals information and provides a
00:29:33 - 00:29:38: mean for privacy concerns I'm now going
00:29:35 - 00:29:40: to explore some of the strengths of chat
00:29:38 - 00:29:43: GPT in terms of blogging writing
00:29:40 - 00:29:46: articles rephrasing and much more we
00:29:43 - 00:29:48: want to create a blog topic and we're
00:29:46 - 00:29:50: going to use chat gbt to assist in that
00:29:48 - 00:29:55: process we're going to request that it
00:29:50 - 00:29:57: provides 10 log topic title ideas for an
00:29:55 - 00:29:59: article that might be something to do
00:29:57 - 00:30:03: with say Graphics design or website
00:29:59 - 00:30:05: Graphics design and that is it
00:30:03 - 00:30:07: from that it's going to give us a list
00:30:05 - 00:30:09: of 10 different types of options we've
00:30:07 - 00:30:12: got things like the essential principles
00:30:09 - 00:30:14: for graphics design role in color common
00:30:12 - 00:30:16: mistakes Etc from this list I'm gonna
00:30:14 - 00:30:19: select option three which I like seven
00:30:16 - 00:30:21: common mistakes to avoid in website
00:30:19 - 00:30:23: Graphics design but I don't particularly
00:30:21 - 00:30:26: like that title just yet so I'm going to
00:30:23 - 00:30:28: ask Chad GPT to give me five variations
00:30:26 - 00:30:30: on that topic title then I'm going to
00:30:28 - 00:30:32: paste in the topic Title Here it gives
00:30:30 - 00:30:34: me five different types of options here
00:30:32 - 00:30:36: but all of them aren't that interesting
00:30:34 - 00:30:39: and I'm actually quite happy with that
00:30:36 - 00:30:41: very first one now we can move into
00:30:39 - 00:30:45: writing the outline for this blog post
00:30:41 - 00:30:46: using chat gbt I'm going to ask it to
00:30:45 - 00:30:49: provide me the outline for the article
00:30:46 - 00:30:51: in clear writing and the title which I
00:30:49 - 00:30:53: picked which is the seven pitfalls to
00:30:51 - 00:30:57: avoid for website Graphics design
00:30:53 - 00:30:59: now I will get a pretty well written
00:30:57 - 00:31:02: outline it'll include include an
00:30:59 - 00:31:04: introduction with a couple of points the
00:31:02 - 00:31:06: seven pitfalls themselves so it'll pick
00:31:04 - 00:31:08: out those pitfalls give me a short
00:31:06 - 00:31:11: summary in dot points of what they are
00:31:08 - 00:31:14: and how they work and then it'll also
00:31:11 - 00:31:16: fill in a conclusion this is pretty much
00:31:14 - 00:31:19: everything that I would need if I was
00:31:16 - 00:31:21: writing a Blog article and this is again
00:31:19 - 00:31:23: still just the beginning because now I'm
00:31:21 - 00:31:25: gonna ask it to even write the
00:31:23 - 00:31:29: introduction for this article and I want
00:31:25 - 00:31:32: it to be at least three sentences long
00:31:29 - 00:31:34: the output here will give me that
00:31:32 - 00:31:36: introduction which is Graphics design
00:31:34 - 00:31:37: plays a crucial role in the success of a
00:31:36 - 00:31:39: website
00:31:37 - 00:31:42: Etc here's where we can start playing
00:31:39 - 00:31:45: around with writing blogs and content in
00:31:42 - 00:31:47: general we could ask chatgpt to rephrase
00:31:45 - 00:31:49: the following sentence and then paste in
00:31:47 - 00:31:52: the sentence we want and here it'll give
00:31:49 - 00:31:54: us an alternative sentence which is a
00:31:52 - 00:31:56: little bit more nuanced I suppose it
00:31:54 - 00:31:58: says the success of a website is heavily
00:31:56 - 00:32:00: influenced by its Graphics design it's
00:31:58 - 00:32:02: essentially saying the same thing but we
00:32:00 - 00:32:04: can also ask chat gbd to do a number of
00:32:02 - 00:32:06: other things such as lengthen the
00:32:04 - 00:32:07: sentence so here it's saying the same
00:32:06 - 00:32:10: sentence but it's a little bit longer
00:32:07 - 00:32:12: the reverse is also true if we've got
00:32:10 - 00:32:15: sentences and that are slightly too
00:32:12 - 00:32:17: large we can also ask cha GPT to shorten
00:32:15 - 00:32:19: them and this provides a shorter version
00:32:17 - 00:32:22: which is very similar to what we
00:32:19 - 00:32:24: originally had and we can even ask it to
00:32:22 - 00:32:25: fix the grammar so say I was just
00:32:24 - 00:32:28: writing my own blog and I wanted to
00:32:25 - 00:32:29: spell check and grammar check then it
00:32:28 - 00:32:32: can work as a bit of a co-writer that
00:32:29 - 00:32:33: there for you essentially making sure
00:32:32 - 00:32:36: that your sentence are good graphics
00:32:33 - 00:32:38: design impact good website comes out
00:32:36 - 00:32:41: essentially saying a good graphics
00:32:38 - 00:32:43: design can impact a good website much
00:32:41 - 00:32:45: better written if you're writing for
00:32:43 - 00:32:48: blogs in different languages Chad GPT
00:32:45 - 00:32:50: can even translate that to pretty much
00:32:48 - 00:32:52: any language I'm just gonna take a guess
00:32:50 - 00:32:55: here and see if it can translate the
00:32:52 - 00:32:57: above statement or sentence into say
00:32:55 - 00:33:00: German in this case I could probably
00:32:57 - 00:33:02: plug this into Google to make sure it's
00:33:00 - 00:33:04: correct but honestly I think I almost
00:33:02 - 00:33:06: trust chatgpt here more within
00:33:04 - 00:33:09: translation than even Google the reverse
00:33:06 - 00:33:11: is also true if you've got something in
00:33:09 - 00:33:12: a different language such as German and
00:33:11 - 00:33:14: you want to translate it back to English
00:33:12 - 00:33:15: you can do that you can even add in
00:33:14 - 00:33:18: things like adding it in a friendly
00:33:15 - 00:33:20: joking way and we get back this example
00:33:18 - 00:33:22: here a good graphics design can totally
00:33:20 - 00:33:25: Rock a website socks off which is pretty
00:33:22 - 00:33:27: funny now that we have a outline for our
00:33:25 - 00:33:29: blog an introduction and say we've
00:33:27 - 00:33:31: written it as well we can even prepare a
00:33:29 - 00:33:34: new newsletter for it to be sent out by
00:33:31 - 00:33:36: email and even have Chad gbt create the
00:33:34 - 00:33:37: subject line for that email here I'm
00:33:36 - 00:33:39: just going to ask it to create the
00:33:37 - 00:33:41: subject line for an email newsletter
00:33:39 - 00:33:43: based on the above and it's going to
00:33:41 - 00:33:45: give me an output here of maximize your
00:33:43 - 00:33:47: website's potential with these Graphics
00:33:45 - 00:33:49: design tips perfect I hope you guys
