Very beautiful
00:03:24 - 00:03:34: There are countless such very beautiful magical temples. It is strange in our country that recently visited Khajuraho 10-15 days ago Khajuraho Late Fest
00:03:34 - 00:03:47: Khajuraho is in Madhya Pradesh and generally all our people had come to Khajuraho for the same purpose. In the temple there, there were many post made graffiti or idols of Kamasutra.
00:03:47 - 00:03:57: So people think it's the same, so when I got the call for the first time, Khajuraho Late Fest, I also said, come on, I have been hearing for a long time that Kamasutra people are all made there,
00:03:57 - 00:04:13: so let's see when I reached there. There is a temple by a Mahamandeshwar. I had not seen such a big Shivling on it till date and there was a Shivling It was raising 1 inch every two-three years.
00:04:13 - 00:04:23: He's on the rise. It grew and continues to grow and they showed me a picture of how he was when he was little. I could clearly see the difference 
00:04:24 - 00:04:34: between the size and the actual size in that picture and not a little bit diffrence, It was such a difference. How much is current That's about 7-8 feet 
wow
00:04:34 - 00:04:49: Means as much as the height of this ceiling
Yes like you believe, The speed with which it is increasing, coming 50-60 years maximum 100 years. The roof which has been made many years old will touch the place
00:04:51 - 00:05:02: Ok, where I was born, Ambikapur District Surguja Chhattisgarh is a small town. I will tell a true incident there. There was a farmer man.
00:05:02 - 00:05:16: he slept one day and he had a dream that Hanumanji was telling him that I am trapped, so the farmer bought the ax the next day.He saw the dream many times means regularly
So he bought the axe. 
00:05:16 - 00:05:24: He knew the way exactly because he saw the dream many times. He knew the way because he was being taken that way every day in his dreams. He reached and started cutting a tree from exact 1 point,
00:05:24 - 00:05:32: then everyone came behind and said why what are you doing, why are you cutting the tree? You said that Hanuman ji is trapped here, people said that he has gone mad, he is disturbed.
00:05:32 - 00:05:43: As people speak for Maanji That I will cut the whole mountain. Everyone said he got mad., he cut again he cut carefully The idol of Hanuman ji has actually come out inside it.
00:05:43 - 00:05:54: And that figure grows every year. I have come here after seeing with my own eyes. There is so much crowd, so much crowd, now it is done. It came out about 8-9 feet and when it came out it was 2- 2.5 feet 
00:05:54 - 00:06:05: It is increasing like this and in that way as well (from everyway). You think there is such a wonderful temple. In Bastar there is a temple of Krishna ji in Bastar. I went there when I was small
00:06:06 - 00:06:20: When we were in the hostel, I think I was in 8th-9th, then there at 7-8 o'clock in the night. It's door which they called gate, people close it and it opens the next day in the morning and in the night
00:06:21 - 00:06:31: Inside it there is a bed for God and the bed was kept very plain like this and in the morning. When the temple opens, it remains completely scattered.
00:06:32 - 00:06:41: So it is believed that from there Lord Krishna comes there and rests for the night, so there was a foreigner sitting there and I have seen it with my own eyes. 
00:06:41 - 00:06:51: This is it when you see it from your eyes then your belive increase So one of the foreigners was sitting. Like how we do Hare Ram Hare Krishna, so he was doing just like that (gesture)
00:06:51 - 00:07:05: then the guide said that he is sitting here for years, when he was told years ago that this happens at night, he peeped at night to see what happened When he saw this, he was very scared.
00:07:05 - 00:07:22: what he was scared of ,he tries to tell What I saw at night, he could not speak. He still can't speak. Have you seen that man?, yes i have seen him he do not have eyes,what he saw, his eyes went away, he tried to tell, his tongue went away.
00:07:22 - 00:07:36: He was sitting in front of me and all of us in the school were standing and looking at him and were talking about him in front of him and he was doing like this (gesture) i'm getting goosebumps right now
00:07:37 - 00:07:44: Sir, as you are telling that the sculpture is in tree is growing now it has become a temple Yes, Proper temple has been built above that the roof have built.
00:07:44 - 00:08:00: Many people come to measure and it is increasing, so you will go to Ambikapur. So, if you talk about it there no one will shock because it is normal. So let me tell you another very interesting thing.
00:08:00 - 00:08:14: You see that Shivji has a snake around his neck.Karthik, the elder son of Lord Shiva. his vehicle is peacock And his younger son is Ganesha, his vehicle is the rat
00:08:14 - 00:08:27: It is such a good practice in my house that we, father and son, all sit together at the table. Everyone does food and drink. Our house have a chill out environment. So you think that this must have happened with all three of them as well. 
00:08:27 - 00:08:43: Shivji, Karthik ji and Ganesh ji would also sit for such a family dinner sometime on the table. If he is also sitting on the table so all of there's Peacock, rat, snake. Those who keep roaming under the parking space table, 
00:08:43 - 00:08:58: snake can eat mouse, peacock can eat snake but No one harms anyone. Now you feel that this frame is a wonderful family. Now all these three are incomplete.
00:08:59 - 00:09:13: until Parvati comes to the table and Who is Parvati? What is Parvati's vehicle? Lion means everything else is water less tea. I have come and the king of the jungle is my vehicle, so who am I?
00:09:13 - 00:09:36: So according in our Hindu tradition family's women name is taken before men. How Abhishek Gaurishankar,  Lakshminarayan, Siyaram, Radha Krishna. Right? So, this was our culture.
00:09:36 - 00:09:53: Hinduism, Muslim, Christian, Sikh. In all religions. All the Gods who are visible and those who are not visible are all mostly men Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh. I will start with myself first.
00:09:53 - 00:10:09: Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh, Allah so when you say Allah.They says the one above is watching. He is watching not she is watching  Guru Nanak Dev Ji, Sir Budh, Jain Mahavir. 
00:10:09 - 00:10:30: All are male. We all male have forgotten that None of these gods can come inside this earth without the permission of a woman. But the problem is, that only 2 people can allow you to enter inside a city, inside a state, inside a province. 
00:10:30 - 00:10:52: One is the king or queen of that place and the 2nd one is doorman. We have exchanged The Queen of the World with The Watchman of the World in our mind. She rules the world, she decides who will come inside, but we have kept them under our feet.
00:10:52 - 00:11:05: They have been made gatekeepers, so from wherever I come the goddess is worshiped there before the God.Sir, I have also heard that the world have been told like this.
00:11:05 - 00:11:14: That Brahma Vishnu Mahesh all three are running the worlds. But he is actually the son of the Goddess, so the Goddess comes above all. And Then these three comes.
00:11:15 - 00:11:23: It is also written like this in one scripture. when you will read Vishnu Puran then you will know that Vishnu came first and he brought Shiva and Brahma.
00:11:23 - 00:11:35: If you read Shiva Purana, you will know that Shiva came first and then he brought Brahma and Vishnu. Most people say that for Shiva is endless (aanant Anadi)because Shiva Purana is more recognized.
00:11:36 - 00:11:50: The devotees of Shiva who believe in Shiva are more in trend. That Shiva came before, but the reality is. See there was a demon whose name was Mahishasura you must have heard .No one could kill Mahishasura. 
00:11:51 - 00:12:05: So Shakti takes the form of Durga and you see that any God, especially these three Gods, you will sometimes see Brahma carrying a trident and a wheel.
00:12:05 - 00:12:14: You will see vishnu most of the time with a wheel not carrying a trident. You will never see Shiva carrying a wheel but with trident.
00:12:15 - 00:12:32: The reason of this is that a body cannot contain the power of all these three. Have you seen fantastic 4, 1st part they all get into 1 body, no, 2nd part in which they all get into 1 body to fight against Villain. 
00:12:32 - 00:12:45: These God can't do this. But when Shakti came into the form of Durga then she took trident from shiva, took the wheel from viahnu and took the oblong water pot from Bhrama.
00:12:45 - 00:12:54: And it is believed that there is cosmic energy of the world in the oblong water pot. It contain universe. So no any male body was able to contain that energy.
00:12:54 - 00:13:05: She comes and she contained all the everthing to finish Mahishasura Now you bring it into science a little bit. 
Electron, Proton, Neutron together made an election. Ok
