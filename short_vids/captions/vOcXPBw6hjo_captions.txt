00:00:00 - 00:00:05: uh when you feel like giving up you have to 
think about what are you doing the people

you this is always what the people want to know  
00:01:10 - 00:01:20: i am 167 though and uh from 55 to 60 kilograms 
when i'm preparing for competition it's like 56.  
00:01:21 - 00:01:28: okay cool and um yeah maybe you want to tell us a 
little bit how did you get in touch with the sport  
00:01:28 - 00:01:36: since when do you do calisthenics and yeah how 
did you start i started with street workout in  
00:01:36 - 00:01:43: calisthenics when i was 18 years old i just 
go outside and saw the people training on the  
00:01:43 - 00:01:50: bars you know and i was like okay let's try 
it and starting with some basic basics for uh  
00:01:50 - 00:01:57: two months then trying some elements and 
that's what happened wow right now you're  
00:01:57 - 00:02:04: 20 years old right yeah yes so um you you're doing 
calisthenics since two two and a half years how  
00:02:04 - 00:02:11: how long yeah two and a half wow that's insane 
and this is where we can already start with with  
00:02:11 - 00:02:18: the questions like how is it possible to come on 
such a high level uh after two and a half years  
00:02:20 - 00:02:27: actually i have a gymnastics background and 
uh maybe this is one of the most important  
00:02:27 - 00:02:35: important questions for the community how how is 
that possible uh the gymnastics uh give me a lot  
00:02:35 - 00:02:42: like you know mobility strange and uh 
when i start with the street workout  
00:02:42 - 00:02:51: i have a lot of basic stuff behind me you know 
like background and that's how it becomes this way  
00:02:51 - 00:02:58: okay so you started with the gymnastics as a kid 
or um yeah i was uh seven years old when i started  
00:02:58 - 00:03:07: with gymnastics and and my career at 13 years old 
wow so uh would you say with 13 on a professional  
00:03:07 - 00:03:15: level or what does it mean yeah it was a really 
high level like uh world cups you know nationals  
00:03:16 - 00:03:24: really good really good level wow and what made 
you switch from uh gymnastics to street workout uh  
00:03:24 - 00:03:33: hard operation like a head injury uh it was not i 
think it was not from gymnastics but uh we cannot  
00:03:33 - 00:03:41: share from where this uh injury comes but uh i 
stopped with the gymnastics because of the injury
00:03:44 - 00:03:52: after that i have like uh five years 
without doing anything you know playing  
00:03:52 - 00:04:02: uh pc games um zero sport wow and uh then one 
day i said to myself just go outside and do it  
00:04:02 - 00:04:08: you need it and why didn't you go 
back to gymnastics but uh sticked with  
00:04:08 - 00:04:17: a street workload you cannot like after uh five 
years you just cannot go back for the same level  
00:04:17 - 00:04:26: you're losing a lot of time like one year is too 
much but five years it's impossible and how were  
00:04:26 - 00:04:31: your beginnings in street workout did you start 
with the basics like push-ups pull-ups or did you  
00:04:31 - 00:04:38: um like train your or continue your gymnastics 
training with planche and front lever and
00:04:40 - 00:04:43: actually it was uh really hard because  
00:04:44 - 00:04:52: i was uh without any musculars after the operation 
you know so many years without any moves and uh i  
00:04:52 - 00:05:00: start with basics of course like normal basics you 
know pull ups push-ups dips two months and then  
00:05:00 - 00:05:07: starting with elements just watching some videos 
you know from youtube from instagram and that's it  
00:05:08 - 00:05:16: did you start uh i can imagine with aesthetics 
more in the beginning or uh did you directly and  
00:05:16 - 00:05:24: then afterwards you added dynamics yeah for sure i 
started uh with statics like uh the first element  
00:05:24 - 00:05:32: i think was uh handstand and maybe one month after 
that i started to learning the straddle planche  
00:05:32 - 00:05:44: and then some dynamics like 360. i will never 
never remember uh i did one 360 and the second one  
00:05:44 - 00:05:51: was three three three sixties the second try 
was three three sixties yeah it was so good wow  
00:05:52 - 00:05:58: okay so uh yeah your your muscle memory or like 
also some technique maybe from the gymnastics  
00:05:58 - 00:06:04: background definitely help you to um to have a 
really quick start in street work that's it yeah  
00:06:04 - 00:06:11: um really really fast progress did you also 
get support from uh because you have like  
00:06:11 - 00:06:17: really strong athletes uh around you like you have 
victor you have stefan erotef like a really strong  
00:06:17 - 00:06:23: athlete um like um how did you meet them and how 
important were they in their in your development  
00:06:25 - 00:06:32: again i meet them on the bars outside but the 
first hand that was given to me was from netco  
00:06:32 - 00:06:40: hmm stefan also helped me a lot victor 
you know they're good guys they're like uh  
00:06:41 - 00:06:44: nothing different than the other 
people so they're really good  
00:06:45 - 00:06:49: and uh just helped me to learn a lot of elements
00:06:51 - 00:06:57: cool and um what was your main motivation 
when you started with a street workout was it  
00:06:57 - 00:07:03: um to become the was it ever to become 
the best athlete in the world or was it  
00:07:04 - 00:07:06: what was your main goal when 
you started with street workout  
00:07:08 - 00:07:18: uh first two or three months it was not to be 
the best in the world it was just to learn skills  
00:07:18 - 00:07:24: i i really like the dynamic skills static 
skills i want to be really strong with them  
00:07:25 - 00:07:34: but after my first competition i was like man go 
for it you need you have to take it and that's how  
00:07:34 - 00:07:45: i really started with a professional career and 
not stopping true let's switch back a few years  
00:07:45 - 00:07:52: um you also did a really emotional instagram post 
about um the time with your injury um which i can  
00:07:52 - 00:07:57: imagine is was like a really difficult time for 
you do you want to share it to share a little  
00:07:57 - 00:08:04: bit a little bit what was happening inside of your 
head what was this time like um yeah again one of  
00:08:04 - 00:08:12: the most uh important questions for the community 
and for me i want to tell the people i was  
00:08:13 - 00:08:24: 14 years old when they when i made my operation 
in austria in the hospital uh it was five hours  
00:08:24 - 00:08:35: hard operation really dangerous one after 
it i was on bed 15 days without any steps  
00:08:35 - 00:08:42: on my legs so that's why i'm telling the people 
i'm starting from zero again yeah without the  
00:08:44 - 00:08:50: moscow memory i'm starting really from the 
beginning from zero from walking step by step it  
00:08:50 - 00:09:01: was really hard day by day and uh after two months 
in hospital i was good and you know i was i was  
00:09:02 - 00:09:11: remember how good i was in gymnastics and maybe 
that's why i'm in this sport right now and uh  
00:09:11 - 00:09:19: i have really strong mindset you know because 
of the operation it teach me a lot for sure oh
00:09:21 - 00:09:25: that's uh yeah like i i don't even know 
what to say to that because it's really  
00:09:25 - 00:09:30: something where a lot of people maybe maybe 
give up um it's a situation that they um  
00:09:30 - 00:09:36: because you also said like did you ever um 
because you were also gaming and like um  
00:09:36 - 00:09:41: uh as it sounds to me like you weren't living 
to your fullest potential for a lot of time  
00:09:41 - 00:09:48: after the operation did you ever had the thought 
of giving up or like of um of not coming back to  
00:09:48 - 00:09:57: this two sports at all of course of course for 
sure like uh i was playing pc games and i said  
00:09:57 - 00:10:04: to myself you don't need this pork you don't need 
any sport you you're like the normal other guys  
00:10:05 - 00:10:13: but uh that's not me one day i said to 
myself that's not you let's go push it and  
00:10:13 - 00:10:19: that's it and what were the the most important 
things to come out of this situation was it  
00:10:19 - 00:10:24: the support of your family was it friends or 
was it just your your mindset your on your own  
00:10:25 - 00:10:32: yeah my family helped me a lot for sure in 
this situation it was really hard and you know
00:10:34 - 00:10:45: only after so many years in sport 
you know how hard gymnastics it is uh  
00:10:46 - 00:10:53: you know discipline i need a discipline again 
i was really disciplined and that's how i do it  
00:10:54 - 00:11:01: cool big respect for that honestly um it's like 
really touching and uh motivating to see your  
00:11:01 - 00:11:07: story and i think it's really important and i 
really respect your um transparency and your  
00:11:07 - 00:11:14: uh that you're so open to to share your emotions 
behind it um so yeah big respect for that so um  
00:11:14 - 00:11:22: yeah um switching to today um today you're on 
an extremely high level you're uh as i said like  
00:11:22 - 00:11:28: um an extremely extreme complete athlete um 
how does your workout look like today like  
00:11:28 - 00:11:36: um how does your typical workout week look 
like i'm training uh five days for a week  
00:11:37 - 00:11:45: uh three times in the gym actually we have four 
times for a week trainings we cannot train more  
00:11:45 - 00:11:51: than four times in a week four hours is the 
maximum when you can train in the gym because  
00:11:51 - 00:11:57: you know it's a gymnastic gym we don't have like 
calisthenics and street workout gyms in bulgaria  
00:11:57 - 00:12:06: we really want to make one but we actually now we 
cannot it's really hard uh i'm training four hours  
00:12:08 - 00:12:14: for a day starting with uh you know good 
warm-up i have some injuries i will tell you  
00:12:14 - 00:12:21: for them uh after that i'm making a 
little bit stretching not that much and  
00:12:23 - 00:12:34: then i'm going with some p-bar statics after 
that making some good combos learning new  
00:12:34 - 00:12:40: elements and then switching to the high bar 
with dynamics and you know crazy combinations  
00:12:41 - 00:12:49: after the you know that crazy combinations 
uh we're going up back to the b bars again  
00:12:49 - 00:12:58: trying some combos for uh endurance and a little 
bit floor game and stretching after that like a  
00:12:58 - 00:13:05: lot of stretching 20 30 minutes will be enough and 
that's how i'm training for four hours per day wow  
00:13:06 - 00:13:13: so um you're uh i see that you're recording 
a lot of your combinations that uh like  
00:13:13 - 00:13:16: impress the whole calisthenic scene that you 
record them at the end of the your workout  
00:13:17 - 00:13:24: um like is that is that usual like is that normal 
that uh like you uh put your best performances  
00:13:24 - 00:13:27: at the end of the workout because usually 
you're the strongest in the beginning right  
00:13:29 - 00:13:36: uh for some people it's not normal like 
you know you're showing uh what you're  
00:13:36 - 00:13:43: gonna do on the competitions and but man 
i'm helping to people like that you know  
00:13:43 - 00:13:49: we're progressing the sport like that and of 
course i will be stronger in the beginning but  
00:13:49 - 00:13:55: that's what we are gonna show on the competition 
okay how strong we are on the beginning
00:13:57 - 00:14:05: okay so um does every workout look the same 
kind of for you no no no for sure no before  
00:14:05 - 00:14:12: the competitions i'm training only combinations 
like again good warm up stretching going on the  
00:14:12 - 00:14:20: high bar this time starting with high bar it 
is easier for me making the combo after that  
00:14:21 - 00:14:28: i'm watching the clock you know 30 seconds 
rest and then going to the b bar with again  
00:14:28 - 00:14:34: long combinations okay and like that you're 
preparing yourself for the endurance that you  
00:14:34 - 00:14:39: need during the competition right yeah this is 
uh the training for endurance for the competition  
00:14:40 - 00:14:49: like when i'm learning a new skill i'm trying it 
on the beginning of the training like maybe 7 20  
00:14:49 - 00:14:56: i'm doing it six or seven times and after that if 
i have problems with it i know how to stop it i'm  
00:14:56 - 00:15:01: stopping with it and making on the next training 
this is the best way to learn some elements  
00:15:02 - 00:15:08: okay because many people just continue continue to 
do it again again and then they hurt themselves or  
00:15:09 - 00:15:18: you have to know when you have to stop okay 
interesting um what do you think is the the  
00:15:18 - 00:15:23: most uh important factor that brought you to the 
level that you are today is it your smart training  
00:15:23 - 00:15:28: schedule is it your physique or genetics is it 
the the gymnastics background if you have to say  
00:15:28 - 00:15:34: like one thing what is the the most important 
of your uh what is the secret of your success
00:15:36 - 00:15:46: smart training i've said smart training that's 
it mindset okay cool um yeah a lot of questions  
00:15:46 - 00:15:51: also about your planche uh which is uh really 
impressive um so do you want to tell us a little  
00:15:51 - 00:15:57: bit about your planche journey um how long did 
it take is it like an easy move for you are  
00:15:57 - 00:16:02: you more the push person um like maybe you 
can tell a little about your planche journey
00:16:05 - 00:16:11: after when i start street workout street 
workout after two months basics then i  
00:16:11 - 00:16:19: start with handstand and uh pledge i made uh 
planche for one month and half half a month  
00:16:20 - 00:16:28: uh i start with some tip planches you know uh 
dropping the straddle from handset negatives and  
00:16:28 - 00:16:36: this is maybe for me the best exercise if you want 
to learn planche uh from straddle to full planche  
00:16:38 - 00:16:44: i i already have uh 15 seconds travel planche 
so i have really strong straddle planche  
00:16:45 - 00:16:52: uh after that i like uh 15 15 
days to learn the full planche  
00:16:52 - 00:16:57: from straddle to full planche 15 days 
with strong stretch of 15 seconds
00:17:00 - 00:17:03: do you know anyone that learned 
the planche that quickly
00:17:10 - 00:17:15: don't hurt don't know really no maybe one 
month and more than one month two months  
00:17:16 - 00:17:23: yeah but uh like 15 days from straw to full no 
yeah because it also seems really really really  
00:17:23 - 00:17:28: quick and maybe this is something that we can tell 
the listeners that this is not normal you know  
00:17:28 - 00:17:33: yeah like the listeners shouldn't be demotivated 
if it takes longer for some people it takes a year  
00:17:33 - 00:17:38: to learn a straddle planche and yeah people are 
not talking about this progress you know like  
00:17:38 - 00:17:45: it's not normal for 15 days you're training uh the 
planche like one year and here is coming the guy  
00:17:45 - 00:17:53: with the five 15 days you know like learning from 
straddle but maybe uh just smart trainings that's  
00:17:53 - 00:18:01: it good system yeah and in your gymnastics 
career you also did planche right yeah but
00:18:03 - 00:18:07: not good i was said this is not 
pledge yeah this is not pledge
00:18:10 - 00:18:16: i think it's really interesting to have 
an x uh gymnast here um and to maybe also  
00:18:16 - 00:18:21: know a little bit about the differences 
between gymnastics and street workout  
00:18:21 - 00:18:24: for you what are what are the main 
differences between the two spores
00:18:27 - 00:18:32: we're playing first we're playing 
on a pivot uh floor and uh however  
00:18:33 - 00:18:42: uh they're playing on six places this 
is one of the hardest things and the  
00:18:42 - 00:18:50: difference and then second uh they're playing 
you know they're trying to be maximum clean  
00:18:51 - 00:18:58: here we can do everything they're playing 
uh by system we are not playing uh  
00:18:58 - 00:19:03: by system we are playing freestyle you know you 
can do whatever you want big difference again
00:19:05 - 00:19:11: okay so the main differences three ones 
to summarize first one is they have six  
00:19:11 - 00:19:18: disciplines and six uh six uh locations where 
they uh do their exercises yes we we only  
00:19:18 - 00:19:24: have three in calisthenics and three world 
cups so uh p bars floor and high bar right  
00:19:24 - 00:19:31: yeah the main one is um and second one is that 
they do everything clean uh like in free and  
00:19:31 - 00:19:40: street workout we have more possibilities yeah 
okay like uh do you have to do it clean what  
00:19:40 - 00:19:45: does that mean like it doesn't count on a 
competition or um is it what does it mean  
00:19:46 - 00:19:53: uh it means like uh you have to be perfect 
when you're on a training and competition too  
00:19:54 - 00:20:01: like you know your legs should be like like 
this okay here we we don't do that because  
00:20:01 - 00:20:06: in stream workout dynamics yeah it's really 
well if you have like training form and a  
00:20:06 - 00:20:12: competition form it's like two different things or 
like even on competitions um i think the rules are  
00:20:12 - 00:20:20: not that strict for for not clean yes and the 
third difference that you say said is like um  
00:20:20 - 00:20:25: for us it's more freestyle we can do whatever we 
want and for them it's uh given uh elements right  
00:20:26 - 00:20:34: yes yes and system system true 
that was it interesting um your  
00:20:34 - 00:20:39: opinion on stretching you said that you stretch in 
the beginning of the workout and yeah at the end  
00:20:39 - 00:20:46: how important is stretching for athlete for 
an athlete uh really important important for  
00:20:47 - 00:20:57: injuries for sure when you have a good stretch 
to your body you can cover yourself by injuries  
00:20:57 - 00:21:05: that's it for sure okay so you do upper body 
and lower body or is there anything specific  
00:21:05 - 00:21:11: that you need to stretch both both together 
yeah upper body and lower body interesting  
00:21:12 - 00:21:17: um what was the hardest skill for you to learn 
what was the skill where you struggled the most
00:21:20 - 00:21:26: for dynamics muscle 540 for 
sure it's really scary you know
00:21:28 - 00:21:36: maybe for statics he festo he faced with them i 
don't really like it i can do like two or three  
00:21:36 - 00:21:47: he festus but i don't like it okay he have a 
lot of pain on it where do you have the pain uh  
00:21:47 - 00:21:54: on my elbows actually i have a really bad injury 
on my left elbow from nine months uh it is  
00:21:54 - 00:22:02: tennis elbow that's the name of the injury it's 
really painful and really hard to recover sure  
00:22:03 - 00:22:06: so for nine months you're um performing with pain  
00:22:07 - 00:22:13: yeah a lot of pain yeah and i know that tennis 
elbow is something that you need so much rest  
00:22:13 - 00:22:20: um yeah rest is the only thing that helps uh 
for it and stretching maybe also but um yeah um  
00:22:21 - 00:22:28: okay um what's your opinion on leg 
training so um like uh do you how do  
00:22:28 - 00:22:36: you consider leg training in street workout 
i think you can train legs one or two times  
00:22:36 - 00:22:45: for the week it's okay if you think about you can 
feel heavier with your legs i think uh this is not  
00:22:45 - 00:22:53: actually possible because you have to stop doing 
uh street workout and training only you know legs
00:22:56 - 00:22:58: okay is it even possible to um  
00:22:59 - 00:23:07: like to train legs on your level like is it is it 
does it help you or is it like more a disadvantage  
00:23:08 - 00:23:17: not helping maybe it is helping how you're 
gonna look only okay yeah and for you what's  
00:23:17 - 00:23:21: more important the the aesthetic or 
the the the power like the performance
00:23:24 - 00:23:35: um the performance i think okay for sure yeah like 
i can imagine so um yeah like um yeah injuries uh  
00:23:35 - 00:23:41: you talked about your elbow um is there anything 
else that's uh like uh what you want to tell  
00:23:41 - 00:23:46: about your injuries what injuries did you have 
and maybe also what did you learn from them  
00:23:48 - 00:23:56: only one injury really bad injury their wall 
tennis elbow and normal injuries on my wrists you  
00:23:56 - 00:24:04: know that's it i don't really have other heart 
injuries or something that i have paid from it  
00:24:05 - 00:24:10: do you think there is a reason why you don't have 
that many injuries even though you're on such a  
00:24:10 - 00:24:15: high level is there anything besides stretching 
that you would recommend yeah of course go to warm  
00:24:15 - 00:24:23: up you know running a little bit to make your 
body hot and ready for preparing good combos  
00:24:24 - 00:24:31: stretching before and after the training training 
five times professional in the week not seven from  
00:24:31 - 00:24:39: seven this is you know you're gonna kill yourself 
and that's it okay and uh stretching do you do  
00:24:39 - 00:24:45: dynamic stretching or static stretch uh stretching 
like uh do you do a lot of movements while  
00:24:45 - 00:24:52: stretching or are you do you stay in the maximum 
stretch position both both both together yeah okay  
00:24:54 - 00:25:02: cool um yeah people also asked about supplements 
like is there anything you would recommend  
00:25:02 - 00:25:08: is it important to take away i like to take 
protein protein powder or creatine or is there  
00:25:08 - 00:25:17: anything that you would recommend i am drinking 
protein way uh two or three times per week  
00:25:18 - 00:25:27: when i'm eating and uh i can recommend call again 
for sure call again cool again okay why that's all  
00:25:28 - 00:25:36: that's all i like it help the only one thing 
that is helping uh to recover my injuries

the video games are not the problem the real  
00:28:12 - 00:28:21: problem is the mindset that's everything okay is 
there anything you would recommend uh to building  
00:28:21 - 00:28:27: a strong mindset is it watching motivational 
videos on youtube or reading or what did help you  
00:28:27 - 00:28:34: the most yeah the people have to remember uh why 
they are started why they start with this sport  
00:28:34 - 00:28:42: and uh what they want when you feel like giving 
up you have to think about what are you doing  
00:28:42 - 00:28:48: why you have to follow your dreams 
and you know that's it great

supporting his friend friends in their goals

what you're but what you feel i want you to say  
00:30:05 - 00:30:08: because if there is someone who is 
not on a high level but he is like  
00:30:08 - 00:30:15: fighting in every rep and he's doing again it's 
like so motivating um that you feel bad like if
