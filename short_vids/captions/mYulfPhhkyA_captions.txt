00:01:24 - 00:01:27: Hello and welcome back to The Resonance Podcast!
00:01:28 - 00:01:34: I´m delighted greeting you back to our format in which everything revolves around the products of Healy World! 
00:01:34 - 00:01:41: Also, I will bring you one step closer to how the daily use of microcurrent frequencies can support you in your daily life 
00:01:41 - 00:01:44: and what great benefits you may achieve using them. 
00:01:44 - 00:01:51: Each month during the week after our online lifestyle event Healy Horizon we will see each other too, to talk about
00:01:51 - 00:01:58: how we can utilize the products of Healy World in accordance with our 12 Months of Healy topics from our Healy calendar.
00:01:58 - 00:02:06: In this month, basically the last month in which you can do your exercises and activities all day long outside without melting 
00:02:06 - 00:02:12: from the sun, we have decided to dedicate the topics Sport, Fitness & Performance to the month of June.
00:02:12 - 00:02:17: I´m pretty sure that we have a lot of sports & fitness enthusiasts amongst us! 
00:02:17 - 00:02:25: You are welcome to share in the chat what sort of exercises you have included to your daily routine or what type of sports you are doing. 
00:02:25 - 00:02:33: In today’s episode I will explain to you why you should use certain Healy World products during or after your sport activities 
00:02:33 - 00:02:39: and why the HealAdvisor Analyse App and it´s modules can support you in your high performing daily life. 
00:02:39 - 00:02:48: I will also give you at the end of this stream my personal program recommendations focused on the topics and why i use 
00:02:48 - 00:02:50: these Healy IMF programs. 
00:02:51 - 00:02:53: Make sure you stay with us till the end!
00:02:53 - 00:03:00: My name is Kai Schulmeyer, I am Healy Worlds Product Marketing Specialist, and it is my true pleasure to be your host today. 
00:03:00 - 00:03:05: Just like with the kickoff in a football game, I want to kick things off today with the topic Fitness, 
00:03:06 - 00:03:10: which of our programs may help you during and or after exercises.
00:03:10 - 00:03:17: Plus, I will reveal a tip how perhaps also you may be able to kiss muscle soreness goodbye for good. 
00:03:17 - 00:03:18: Isn´t it nice? 
00:03:18 - 00:03:20: You had a great day at work! 
00:03:20 - 00:03:27: Everything was going smoothly; you took care of a lot of tasks, and you are going home happily and satisfied 
00:03:27 - 00:03:30: and maybe you are coming home to watch the Resonance Podcast now.
00:03:30 - 00:03:32: What a fantastic day!
00:03:32 - 00:03:40: Later this evening when the sun slowly starts to dawn and a nice breeze is going you decide to put the cherry on top of this day
00:03:40 - 00:03:45: and you decide to go out to go on a run, or to do cross-fit outside or play ball with your friends, 
00:03:46 - 00:03:48: just this sort of sport that you enjoy. 
00:03:49 - 00:03:53: After a while you go back home and everybody knows what is up next…
00:03:54 - 00:03:59: a relaxing and replenishing, warm shower to ease the muscles after exercise.
00:03:59 - 00:04:05: After a healthy and nourishing dinner, we spend some time with our family and with the great day we just had,
00:04:05 - 00:04:11: we also manage to go to be early to get our precious and regenerating night sleep. 
00:04:12 - 00:04:20: After hopefully at least 7 hours we wake up and there it is, the reminder that we should exercise more and do sports regularly 
00:04:20 - 00:04:27: to not be amongst the 27% of adults who do not meet the WHOs recommended level of physical activity. 
00:04:27 - 00:04:30: It’s the muscle soreness which kicks in. 
00:04:31 - 00:04:35: That is always the sour taste we get to an invigorating exercise, right?
00:04:36 - 00:04:42: And now imagine that you have the possibility to look back at the fantastic day we had yesterday
00:04:42 - 00:04:44: but without feeling your entire body today!
00:04:45 - 00:04:50: Physical and Mental Fitness is so important for every human being as it improves your quality of sleep, 
00:04:50 - 00:04:52: promotes a better mood
00:04:52 - 00:04:53: and a higher self-esteem.
00:04:54 - 00:04:59: These are just a few benefits, there are a whole lot more, for example a better focus and memory!
00:05:00 - 00:05:05: Show muscle soreness the red card and bench it now and for good with our Fitness program group!
00:05:05 - 00:05:14: This variety of 8 unique Healy IMF programs were solely created to support you before, during and after your fitness activities!
00:05:14 - 00:05:19: As always, I want to introduce a few programs a little closer to you
00:05:19 - 00:05:24: and since it fits perfectly to our monthly topics, we will go with the Performance Program first.
00:05:25 - 00:05:32: This my dears is the program I am running when I am at the gym or when I am jogging I want to encourage you to try it out too.
00:05:32 - 00:05:36: This very program is supposed to harmonize the Bioenergetic Field
00:05:36 - 00:05:38: that supports your desire to excel! 
00:05:39 - 00:05:40: So, if you are a high performer,
00:05:40 - 00:05:48: let´s perform even higher and grow out your limits to excel ourselves and to reach milestones in fitness, we never knew they exist! 
00:05:49 - 00:05:53: I want to take this perfect chance to talk about one program of this group, 
00:05:53 - 00:05:56: about what some people have a misconception about,
00:05:56 - 00:06:00: and I want to use this short introduction to clear up the smoke about it.
00:06:00 - 00:06:06: I am talking about the weight program, which is not, and I repeat, not a weight-loss program.
00:06:06 - 00:06:10: Weight harmonizes the Bioenergetic Field of the body´s energy balance,
00:06:10 - 00:06:13: it also supports you during the exercises very well 
00:06:13 - 00:06:19: to be energetically not too far on either side to promote a good and energetic balance! 
00:06:20 - 00:06:22: You are probably thinking now, uhm,
00:06:22 - 00:06:25: didn´t Kai spoke about showing Muscle soreness the red card?
00:06:25 - 00:06:26: Right! 
00:06:27 - 00:06:27: I did! 
00:06:27 - 00:06:32: But I want to wait to reveal this for when I will give you my personal program recommendations
00:06:32 - 00:06:36: and choose as the third program for now the circulation program.
00:06:37 - 00:06:39: This is a rather short program 
00:06:39 - 00:06:42: and I recommend using it prior to your fitness sessions,
00:06:42 - 00:06:44: as it harmonizes the Bioenergetic Field
00:06:44 - 00:06:46: for your demands of exercise. 
00:06:46 - 00:06:48: I for myself ride my bicycle to the gym
00:06:49 - 00:06:51: and since this program is only 30 minutes long,
00:06:51 - 00:06:54: it is fitting perfectly in the time between getting ready
00:06:54 - 00:06:55: riding to the gym 
00:06:55 - 00:06:57: and starting the training. 
00:06:57 - 00:07:04: I personally feel sort of assured that what I ever exercise I have planned to do will work out the way i have planned it
00:07:04 - 00:07:07: and that I will achieve with my training whatever I want to achieve.
00:07:08 - 00:07:14: For some sport activities it applies that it is simply more fun when you have a training buddy with you, right? 
00:07:14 - 00:07:18: This person will cheer you up when you feel like you can no more.
00:07:18 - 00:07:24: Surely you are doing the same in return, but why not also treat your training partner too? 
00:07:24 - 00:07:26: Our latest innovation, MagHealy
00:07:27 - 00:07:30: offers you the Workout Program of the Atmosphere Applications,
00:07:30 - 00:07:35: which harmonizes your surrounding space to create an energetic field for your workout. 
00:07:36 - 00:07:40: Since MagHealy emits Quantum Analyzed Frequencies in your surrounding space
00:07:41 - 00:07:44: everybody in its range will benefit from this program too
00:07:44 - 00:07:45: which means
00:07:45 - 00:07:49: that your training buddy can benefit from the program you are running too.
00:07:49 - 00:07:50: Psst!
00:07:50 - 00:07:52: A little Pro Tip!
00:07:52 - 00:07:56: MagHealys Water Activation Application offers you a Fitness program
00:07:56 - 00:07:59: with what you can modify the coherent structure of water
00:08:00 - 00:08:02: to harmonize the Bioenergetic Field of the Muscles. 
00:08:02 - 00:08:06: This program might change your fitness experiences for good. 
00:08:07 - 00:08:09: We deliver frequencies for YOUR life! 
00:08:09 - 00:08:10: In every manner, 
00:08:11 - 00:08:12: for every activity! 
00:08:13 - 00:08:17: The IMF Program Group Fitness is available in our Healy Resonance, 
00:08:17 - 00:08:19: Resonance Plus & Professional Edition 
00:08:19 - 00:08:23: and will be yours if you decide for any of these three Editions.
00:08:23 - 00:08:28: For those amongst us who own or want to get any Edition below the Healy Resonance, 
00:08:28 - 00:08:31: you can subscribe to this great program group throughout our Shop too.
00:08:41 - 00:08:44: Next up I want to talk about a little game changer of ours! 
00:08:45 - 00:08:48: A little gadget we all love lots and conveniently, 
00:08:48 - 00:08:52: all fitness programs and more can be used in combination with it.
00:08:52 - 00:08:55: I am talking about the Healy Coil and, let´s be honest, 
00:08:56 - 00:09:00: using the Coil while doing any sort of sports is very comfortable, 
00:09:00 - 00:09:06: since we do not have to attach any kind of cables to our body to follow our frequency habit. 
00:09:06 - 00:09:08: Picture yourself in a gym for example. 
00:09:09 - 00:09:12: You are on the stepper, or you are doing curls, or lift weights. 
00:09:12 - 00:09:14: As I pointed out earlier
00:09:14 - 00:09:18: I for myself mostly run the performance program when I am exercising 
00:09:18 - 00:09:23: and to be free of cables, I like to use the Healy Coil while running this program
00:09:23 - 00:09:26: to have my hands free and won’t get tangled during the exercise. 
00:09:27 - 00:09:33: If you ask yourself now, so why should I use the wires at all? Here comes the explanation.
00:09:33 - 00:09:39: Using the Healy with any of our electrodes provides you with not only frequencies, but also with microcurrent 
00:09:39 - 00:09:44: whereas the Healy Coil transmits frequencies through quantum potentials.
00:09:44 - 00:09:47: But how does the coil actually work now? 
00:09:47 - 00:09:49: Like I said a few moments before, 
00:09:49 - 00:09:53: the Healy Coil transmits frequencies through quantum potentials,
00:09:53 - 00:09:55:  which makes it a QPF,
00:09:56 - 00:09:58: a quantum potential frequency. 
00:09:58 - 00:10:02: Let´s talk about this for a second to give you a glimpse of what a QPF is. 
00:10:02 - 00:10:10: The very well-known and renowned inventor and physicist Nikola Test spent a large part of his time for experiments
00:10:10 - 00:10:12: demonstrating that under perfect resonance,
00:10:12 - 00:10:18: lossless wireless transmission of energy and information over long distances is possible. 
00:10:19 - 00:10:25: From the gathered results of his experiments, he concluded the existence of a so far unknown type of waves. 
00:10:26 - 00:10:34: David Bohm, an American quantum physicist predicted such an effect in 1959 and it was experimentally proven not long after
00:10:34 - 00:10:41: which was the birth hour of the Aharanov-Bohm effects which revealed the effect of hidden quantum fields. 
00:10:42 - 00:10:49: The so-called Quantum Potential Frequencies originate from two opposing magnetic fields which cancel each other out, 
00:10:49 - 00:10:53: with the magnetic quantum potential nevertheless remaining uncharged, 
00:10:53 - 00:10:55: which is the Aharanov-Bohm effect.
00:10:56 - 00:11:02: QPFs can thus resonate with the biological organisms without the transmission of physical energy. 
00:11:03 - 00:11:09: In this way, frequencies can be transmitted via Quantum Potential Fields without using cables.
00:11:09 - 00:11:11: You have now heard it for yourself! 
00:11:11 - 00:11:16: Using the Healy with cables offers you a whole lot of benefits and should not be neglected.
00:11:16 - 00:11:22: Find a good balance of using your Healy programs with cables, as well as with the Healy Coil. 
00:11:22 - 00:11:23: Here is a little fun fact!
00:11:24 - 00:11:29: We say to please not run more than three programs a day using cables with electrodes,
00:11:29 - 00:11:33: but using the Healy Coil you can use a few on top. 
00:11:33 - 00:11:39: Hence you can do your IMF program routine, plus add maybe one or two more, just for the wellness of it. 
00:11:40 - 00:11:45: When you use the Healy with its cables you can feel that something is happening right away as the microcurrent is
00:11:45 - 00:11:49: tickling you wherever you have attached the electrodes to. 
00:11:49 - 00:11:51: Our Co-Founder and owner Christian Halper 
00:11:51 - 00:11:59: described during the launch period of this product the effect of applying an IMF with the Healy Coil in wonderful way
00:11:59 - 00:12:07: as he said that the effects and benefits of our programs are coming more subtle than how it is while using for example the wristband electrodes. 
00:12:08 - 00:12:13: Healy World creates revolutionary products and opportunities to empower you to thrive 
00:12:13 - 00:12:17: and to live a life of freedom, passion and joy! 
00:12:26 - 00:12:33: In the last month´s episode of The Resonance Podcast we have learned about the HealAdvisor Analyse Personal Coach Module 
00:12:33 - 00:12:38: and how it can support you to overcome challenging times in life, such as personal relationships, 
00:12:38 - 00:12:40: spirituality
00:12:40 - 00:12:41: and self-love for example. 
00:12:42 - 00:12:49: This Module also has a brother which is the Successcoach Module what will also be our final topic for today.
00:12:50 - 00:12:54: On our way to success, we human beings can fail many times. 
00:12:54 - 00:13:00: Quite a few of the now or already passed away super successful people failed many times
00:13:00 - 00:13:03: before they had their real big success!
00:13:03 - 00:13:06: Let me encourage you to never give up and chase your dreams. 
00:13:07 - 00:13:09: Sometimes it just happens,
00:13:09 - 00:13:10: we do not know why,
00:13:11 - 00:13:13: but we keep failing our tasks.
00:13:13 - 00:13:16: Even though it seems that everything is going according to plan
00:13:16 - 00:13:20: we mess up and the plan we have worked up has been proven not useful. 
00:13:21 - 00:13:25: After this happens once or twice, we are at a point where we consider a Coaching
00:13:25 - 00:13:28: and let me tell you, Coaching is help for self-help!
00:13:29 - 00:13:35: The solution to many of your questions, problems, and tasks in life, usually lie within us self. 
00:13:35 - 00:13:44: Often you just need a little support to help recognize these solutions and information, to bring them to light and to use them.
00:13:44 - 00:13:49: Coaching can effectively help you and others to get things moving when you´re stalled
00:13:49 - 00:13:52: and to identify blind spots in your reality 
00:13:52 - 00:13:57: which are the facets of your personality that you are not aware of but that keep blocking you. 
00:13:57 - 00:14:02: Only when you can see clearly can you make decisions and initiate much-needed change.
00:14:02 - 00:14:05: Here are some amazing facts about coaching!
00:14:05 - 00:14:10: 80% of people who receive coaching say their self-confidence increased,
00:14:10 - 00:14:14: 70% of those who are coached improved their work-performance.
00:14:14 - 00:14:17: I also want to mention, as I love this figure very much, 
00:14:17 - 00:14:23: that 73% of coaching clients report that coaching helps them improve their work performance,
00:14:23 - 00:14:30: communication-skills, interpersonal-skills, relationships, work-life-balance and wellness! 
00:14:30 - 00:14:35: Healy World invented the HealAdvisor Analyse Coaching Modules to empower you  
00:14:35 - 00:14:39: to be your own coach by using the principle of quantum entanglement.
00:14:39 - 00:14:45: Let´s dive into topic of quantum entanglement for a second, so we all have the same starting point.
00:14:46 - 00:14:53: Quantum entanglement is a physical phenomenon which occurs when pairs or groups of particles are generated and interact in a way
00:14:54 - 00:15:00: that the quantum state of each particle cannot be described independently of the state of the others,
00:15:00 - 00:15:08: even when the particles are separated by a large distance – instead, a quantum state must be described for the system as a whole. 
00:15:09 - 00:15:16: The HealAdvisor Analyse Coaching Modules uses this principle to support you in unfolding your full potential! 
00:15:16 - 00:15:20: Once we have started the App, we simply have to put a S.M.A.R.T. – Goal in 
00:15:20 - 00:15:26: which stands for Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic and timely
00:15:26 - 00:15:32: and choose a few of our hundreds of little entries of our four main Success Coach Module databases
00:15:33 - 00:15:34: which are Career, 
00:15:34 - 00:15:36: Finances, Goals and Potentials. 
00:15:37 - 00:15:41: There is a golden rule of how many entries you should use of these many entries
00:15:42 - 00:15:45: As many as needed, but as few as possible. 
00:15:46 - 00:15:53: After you took care of this you will be able to run a coaching analysis with our HealAdvisor Analyze App in the Information Field,
00:15:53 - 00:15:58: in order to support you in identifying what currently stands in your way to success! 
00:15:58 - 00:16:02: Just in case that you have missed the last episode of The Resonance Podcast,
00:16:02 - 00:16:05: let me quickly introduce you the Information Field, 
00:16:05 - 00:16:08: but only in a few words, since this is a very big topic to cover.
00:16:09 - 00:16:14: Healy is based on the definition and operation of the information field of Burkhard Heim. 
00:16:14 - 00:16:20: He described Information Fields in his 12-dimensional concept of the universe as an area
00:16:20 - 00:16:26: whereby all mental and physical processes come together and remain stored there as information patterns. 
00:16:27 - 00:16:34: We at Healy World believe that our mental and emotional issues are stored in this global Information Field from which they can be retrieved 
00:16:34 - 00:16:37: using the principle of quantum entanglement.
00:16:37 - 00:16:40: And with our HealAdvisor Success Coach Module
00:16:40 - 00:16:46: we deliver you one more Module for the HealAdvisor Analyze App to analyze positive aspects
00:16:46 - 00:16:52: and thereby create stronger awareness in order to bring these aspects into a stronger focus in your life.
00:16:53 - 00:17:00: Wow! What a wonderful tool to support us on our road to a better performance in whatever aspect of our life’s! 
00:17:00 - 00:17:07: The wonderful HealAdvisor Analyze Success Coach Module is included to our Healy Resonance Plus and Professional Edition.
00:17:07 - 00:17:09: But that´s not it, my dears! 
00:17:10 - 00:17:13: The Success Coach Module also includes the Personal Coach Module, 
00:17:13 - 00:17:20: which aims to support you in your personal relationships, instead of career matters like the Success Coach Module is doing. 
00:17:20 - 00:17:27: This means that you will get 6 databases for this Module on top of the four topics of the Success Coach Module, 
00:17:27 - 00:17:29: for your holistic coaching experience. 
00:17:30 - 00:17:35: But if you wish to just purchase either one of the HealAdvisor Analyse Coaching Modules independently 
00:17:35 - 00:17:41: you can absolutely do so by adding the desired one to your shopping cart on our shop website.  
00:17:50 - 00:17:54: We are close to the end of the fourth episode of The Resonance Podcast!
00:17:54 - 00:17:56: And like is said in the beginning of this episode
00:17:56 - 00:18:01: I will now give you my personal program recommendations of the Fitness program page 
00:18:01 - 00:18:05: and for what reason I have used the success coach module previously
00:18:05 - 00:18:08: and in which situations I use our Healy Coil.
00:18:09 - 00:18:15: If you had just as much fun as I had today, I would appreciate if you would give me a thumbs up for my stream
00:18:15 - 00:18:19: and if you share this video with everyone you think should see it too.
00:18:19 - 00:18:23: Now it is time to reveal how you can bench muscle soreness for the rest of time! 
00:18:24 - 00:18:31: The Fitness Page Program I like the most is for me personally unrivaled the Deep Relaxation Program!
00:18:31 - 00:18:37: I always run this very program after my gym time or whatever sports activity I have just finished. 
00:18:37 - 00:18:45: I was equally amazed and surprised when I woke up the first morning after using it the day before and I had no muscle soreness.
00:18:45 - 00:18:46: But feel for yourself! 
00:18:47 - 00:18:48: The Healy Coil, 
00:18:48 - 00:18:49: what a lovely little gadget!
00:18:49 - 00:18:52: I mostly use the Healy Coil while exercising, 
00:18:52 - 00:18:59: since it is how I said before, it’s convenient to not be attached to wires while being at the gym for example. 
00:18:59 - 00:19:04: But I also like to run my Healy IMF Program with the Healy Coil while cooking,
00:19:04 - 00:19:07: because I don’t get tangled while stirring something in the pot.
00:19:07 - 00:19:08: Remember,
00:19:08 - 00:19:16:  it is complementary to the use with electrodes and cables and not to be meant as a substitution for the use with cables.
00:19:17 - 00:19:22: I use the HealAdvisor Analyse Success Coach Module regularly to be honest, 
00:19:22 - 00:19:28: as this is my way to find out in which direction I should work to thrive and improve my working performance,
00:19:28 - 00:19:33: how to achieve my goals and to identify hidden potentials of my personality.
00:19:34 - 00:19:37: Have you seen our latest episode of Healy Horizon yet?
