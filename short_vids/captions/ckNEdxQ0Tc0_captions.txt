00:00:00 - 00:00:25: [Music]
00:00:29 - 00:00:33: n
00:00:31 - 00:00:34: I'm not going to ask you anything
00:00:33 - 00:00:37: generic or anything I've heard you
00:00:34 - 00:00:39: answer already uh I'm going to be a
00:00:37 - 00:00:42: little selfish and ask you questions
00:00:39 - 00:00:44: that uh I try to answer for myself a lot
00:00:42 - 00:00:48: of the time maybe like you know uh
00:00:44 - 00:00:53: there's no better person to learn
00:00:48 - 00:00:56: [Music]
00:00:53 - 00:01:00: from so we do this once in a month Bill
00:00:56 - 00:01:03: and uh we primarily cater to to the
00:01:00 - 00:01:06: young entrepreneur in India uh the idea
00:01:03 - 00:01:10: is to get really good people on the show
00:01:06 - 00:01:12: and help a young 20-year-old boy or girl
00:01:10 - 00:01:16: in India who's looking to become an
00:01:12 - 00:01:18: entrepreneur give them uh advice
00:01:16 - 00:01:21: guidance help them learn from what you
00:01:18 - 00:01:23: might have learned already I've met Bill
00:01:21 - 00:01:26: a bunch of times I think the very first
00:01:23 - 00:01:29: time I met you was uh when I caught you
00:01:26 - 00:01:31: at we and bugged you for an hour with
00:01:29 - 00:01:34: random questions a few years ago I
00:01:31 - 00:01:36: joined Bill's bch last year thank uh the
00:01:34 - 00:01:39: one thing I want to clarify is a lot of
00:01:36 - 00:01:40: Indians when they hear about a Indian
00:01:39 - 00:01:42: sign on to the pledge I think there's
00:01:40 - 00:01:45: four of us right we're all from
00:01:42 - 00:01:48: Bangalore and all of us are friends uh
00:01:45 - 00:01:50: people somehow assume that the money is
00:01:48 - 00:01:53: going out of India the money which is
00:01:50 - 00:01:56: going to make Society better uh it's
00:01:53 - 00:01:58: actually not the case and uh I would
00:01:56 - 00:02:01: also like to say I think the Gates
00:01:58 - 00:02:03: Foundation who I work worked with in the
00:02:01 - 00:02:05: past we've done a school project
00:02:03 - 00:02:09: together we're doing something around
00:02:05 - 00:02:11: malnutrition together I think the impact
00:02:09 - 00:02:15: and the effort that they're putting into
00:02:11 - 00:02:17: India in improving Society uh is is uh
00:02:15 - 00:02:19: is great and I hope you guys continue
00:02:17 - 00:02:21: this association with India for a long
00:02:19 - 00:02:24: time do you want to talk a little bit
00:02:21 - 00:02:26: about your relationship with India and
00:02:24 - 00:02:29: how it's evolved over the last many
00:02:26 - 00:02:30: years well I've been I've had a
00:02:29 - 00:02:33: fantastic relationship with India
00:02:30 - 00:02:35: starting with the the Microsoft
00:02:33 - 00:02:38: experience where and we hired some very
00:02:35 - 00:02:41: smart I graduates brought them to cattle
00:02:38 - 00:02:44: later they go back uh create a
00:02:41 - 00:02:47: development center for us uh that's now
00:02:44 - 00:02:50: in four locations 25,000 people and of
00:02:47 - 00:02:53: course a lot of the amazing people I
00:02:50 - 00:02:55: work with and have so much fun uh in the
00:02:53 - 00:02:58: Microsoft success with are part of the
00:02:55 - 00:03:02: team who had hired from India you know
00:02:58 - 00:03:05: top of that list is SAA uh who know uh
00:03:02 - 00:03:09: is doing a great job of CEO so in my
00:03:05 - 00:03:13: digital first career uh the connection
00:03:09 - 00:03:17: to India was uh fun and made a huge
00:03:13 - 00:03:19: difference um in what the company was
00:03:17 - 00:03:21: able to achieve it was during that time
00:03:19 - 00:03:24: that I was kind of learning oh wow India
00:03:21 - 00:03:27: is such a study and contrast you know
00:03:24 - 00:03:30: you know first class in so many ways but
00:03:27 - 00:03:32: still a lot of poverty uh and challenges
00:03:30 - 00:03:35: and uh you know I was beginning to think
00:03:32 - 00:03:40: okay how do I give this money back uh
00:03:35 - 00:03:42: together with u Melinda and so she came
00:03:40 - 00:03:44: over as we were starting to do
00:03:42 - 00:03:48: foundation work um I start the
00:03:44 - 00:03:52: foundation I fund it in the year 2000 so
00:03:48 - 00:03:56: I'm 45 years old and still um
00:03:52 - 00:03:57: full-time I stayed full-time for another
00:03:56 - 00:04:00: uh eight
00:03:57 - 00:04:03: years uh but IND you become comes you
00:04:00 - 00:04:04: know an important place for us because
00:04:03 - 00:04:08: we realize that
00:04:04 - 00:04:11: vaccines uh were this missing uh thing
00:04:08 - 00:04:13: and it was a crime that these uh
00:04:11 - 00:04:15: diarrhea rotavirus vaccines were getting
00:04:13 - 00:04:18: to the rich kids so you know I get to
00:04:15 - 00:04:22: know serum I learn
00:04:18 - 00:04:24: about making cheap uh
00:04:22 - 00:04:25: vaccines uh you know the Indian
00:04:24 - 00:04:28: government at the time had not adopted
00:04:25 - 00:04:32: new vaccines for a long time you know so
00:04:28 - 00:04:35: uh how do we is foreigners uh form
00:04:32 - 00:04:37: Partnerships and not come across uh in
00:04:35 - 00:04:40: the wrong way so it's a heck of a
00:04:37 - 00:04:43: learning curve uh another big program we
00:04:40 - 00:04:46: had here at the start called avahan uh
00:04:43 - 00:04:49: was about making sure that the HIV
00:04:46 - 00:04:53: epidemic didn't explode you know by
00:04:49 - 00:04:55: making sure that um the sex workers were
00:04:53 - 00:04:58: insisting on conomus and so that the the
00:04:55 - 00:05:01: numbers would stay small and that was
00:04:58 - 00:05:04: also quite successful and very much a
00:05:01 - 00:05:05: partnership with the government um you
00:05:04 - 00:05:08: know other than the US this is the
00:05:05 - 00:05:10: country we spend the most money in uh we
00:05:08 - 00:05:12: have a fantastic team of people here do
00:05:10 - 00:05:13: you want to put a number to that in
00:05:12 - 00:05:16: terms of the scale of how much the
00:05:13 - 00:05:20: foundation does in India yeah we do uh
00:05:16 - 00:05:22: if you take direct and indirect uh it'd
00:05:20 - 00:05:26: be close to a billion a year you know we
00:05:22 - 00:05:28: help buy vaccines through uh gavi we uh
00:05:26 - 00:05:31: fund a lot of different things our
00:05:28 - 00:05:34: foundation is about 9 billion a year and
00:05:31 - 00:05:37: our health is our biggest agriculture is
00:05:34 - 00:05:40: our second biggest education uh although
00:05:37 - 00:05:42: super important uh it's not uh super
00:05:40 - 00:05:46: high percentage because we're
00:05:42 - 00:05:49: so specialized on the health stuff uh
00:05:46 - 00:05:52: and we've had so much uh progress on
00:05:49 - 00:05:55: that we want to uh make sure we do that
00:05:52 - 00:05:56: super well I'm not going to ask you
00:05:55 - 00:06:00: anything generic or anything I've heard
00:05:56 - 00:06:02: you answer already uh I'm going to be a
00:06:00 - 00:06:05: little selfish and ask you questions
00:06:02 - 00:06:07: that uh I try to answer for myself a lot
00:06:05 - 00:06:09: of the time maybe like you know uh
00:06:07 - 00:06:12: there's no better person to learn from
00:06:09 - 00:06:16: when it comes to uh Society at
00:06:12 - 00:06:20: large a lot of really wealthy people
00:06:16 - 00:06:23: today uh are virtue signaling in the
00:06:20 - 00:06:27: manner that being wealthy is a Bad Thing
00:06:23 - 00:06:30: somehow it it it's starting to seem like
00:06:27 - 00:06:33: the class and race divides of yesterday
00:06:30 - 00:06:36: has become the new uh wealth divide has
00:06:33 - 00:06:38: become that thing in society today uh
00:06:36 - 00:06:41: which is very socialist in the very
00:06:38 - 00:06:43: thinking of it inherently socialist when
00:06:41 - 00:06:46: people think of it that way and when I
00:06:43 - 00:06:48: go on my own path of philanthropy I
00:06:46 - 00:06:52: often ask myself like even at the pledge
00:06:48 - 00:06:54: I find myself asking this question does
00:06:52 - 00:06:58: philanthropy in that sense truly makes
00:06:54 - 00:07:01: sense and me as a 37y old who's starting
00:06:58 - 00:07:04: on this path how do I think about this
00:07:01 - 00:07:06: well there are some things that only
00:07:04 - 00:07:10: philanthropy can do because they require
00:07:06 - 00:07:13: taking risks and you know the basic
00:07:10 - 00:07:14: needs of the people the safety net
00:07:13 - 00:07:16: that's not really the role of
00:07:14 - 00:07:18: philanthropy because you need to count
00:07:16 - 00:07:20: on that year in and year out and the
00:07:18 - 00:07:23: government you know through the
00:07:20 - 00:07:26: political process needs to decide that
00:07:23 - 00:07:28: and of course the market-based system is
00:07:26 - 00:07:30: where most of this wealth comes from and
00:07:28 - 00:07:33: anything the market can do you know like
00:07:30 - 00:07:36: how many restaurants like this should we
00:07:33 - 00:07:40: have you know the market does that so
00:07:36 - 00:07:42: well but we know there are
00:07:40 - 00:07:45: diseases and
00:07:42 - 00:07:48: challenges that either the government's
00:07:45 - 00:07:51: not Innovative enough or the market
00:07:48 - 00:07:55: opportuni is not enough that the two big
00:07:51 - 00:07:57: actors you know private sector you know
00:07:55 - 00:07:59: which is like you know 70% of the
00:07:57 - 00:08:00: economy and you know the government
00:07:59 - 00:08:02: which is like
00:08:00 - 00:08:03: 28% this third sector which is only a
00:08:02 - 00:08:09: few
00:08:03 - 00:08:11: percent can step in to do when we had uh
00:08:09 - 00:08:14: Democratic capitalism there was always
00:08:11 - 00:08:16: this concern that the poorest would kind
00:08:14 - 00:08:18: of overtax the Rich and that the
00:08:16 - 00:08:20: incentive system would be broken down in
00:08:18 - 00:08:23: fact you know that really hasn't
00:08:20 - 00:08:26: happened you you have in northern Europe
00:08:23 - 00:08:29: very high tax rates but even there the
00:08:26 - 00:08:31: incentive system works so I think it's
00:08:29 - 00:08:34: it's important to separate out is my
00:08:31 - 00:08:37: country's tax system as Progressive as
00:08:34 - 00:08:39: it should be uh so when you look at
00:08:37 - 00:08:41: billionaires you know do they kind of
00:08:39 - 00:08:43: have more than they should and then if
00:08:41 - 00:08:46: you look at whatever the billionaires
00:08:43 - 00:08:51: have o left over after they paid their
00:08:46 - 00:08:53: taxes are they engaging in thoughtful uh
00:08:51 - 00:08:56: philanthropy are they kind of spoiling
00:08:53 - 00:08:58: their children uh who are kind of
00:08:56 - 00:09:00: arrogant to view themselves in a class
00:08:58 - 00:09:02: of Their Own
00:09:00 - 00:09:05: uh and being kind of extravagant in what
00:09:02 - 00:09:09: they do and that's very hard you know to
00:09:05 - 00:09:11: draw the line what is uh that
00:09:09 - 00:09:14: responsibility even with the giving
00:09:11 - 00:09:16: pledge this idea give back half you know
00:09:14 - 00:09:19: some people say well half if you have
00:09:16 - 00:09:22: you know $4 billion dollar that means
00:09:19 - 00:09:25: for your own consumption and your your
00:09:22 - 00:09:27: family you're keeping two billion well
00:09:25 - 00:09:30: it's not a upper bound we'll have you
00:09:27 - 00:09:33: know people who will give away
00:09:30 - 00:09:34: 99% but it and it's great to debate
00:09:33 - 00:09:39: these things
00:09:34 - 00:09:41: because um you know we're not trying to
00:09:39 - 00:09:44: take over government functions we
00:09:41 - 00:09:47: couldn't possibly afford afford to do
00:09:44 - 00:09:49: that uh but a lot of the best government
00:09:47 - 00:09:51: programs if you look into them some
00:09:49 - 00:09:53: philanthropist funded the pilot you know
00:09:51 - 00:09:57: brought together talented people and
00:09:53 - 00:09:59: often you're using the same skills that
00:09:57 - 00:10:02: you cause you to be able to be
00:09:59 - 00:10:04: successful and now using it on behalf of
00:10:02 - 00:10:08: of equality you know how do you design a
00:10:04 - 00:10:12: school or take AI technology into a a
00:10:08 - 00:10:15: farmer's advisory system uh and that
00:10:12 - 00:10:18: that experience that sense of
00:10:15 - 00:10:21: urgency uh can be very helpful in
00:10:18 - 00:10:23: philanthropic Innovation I'm I'm with
00:10:21 - 00:10:25: you when you say that the anomalies of
00:10:23 - 00:10:28: capitalism the billionaires on the very
00:10:25 - 00:10:31: end should be taxed higher but if you
00:10:28 - 00:10:34: had to redesign societ do you think
00:10:31 - 00:10:37: capitalism over socialism any day well
00:10:34 - 00:10:39: capitalism gives you the freedom to
00:10:37 - 00:10:42: start a new business and try out a new
00:10:39 - 00:10:44: product and the idea of okay who do
00:10:42 - 00:10:46: people choose to buy
00:10:44 - 00:10:49: from that's a form of freedom because
00:10:46 - 00:10:51: it's not based on your background or
00:10:49 - 00:10:56: your class or something like that and so
00:10:51 - 00:10:57: the discovery power of the capitalistic
00:10:56 - 00:10:59: Market to oh this guy knows how to do
00:10:57 - 00:11:02: this cheaper this guy knows how to do
00:10:59 - 00:11:05: this better oh you know people are
00:11:02 - 00:11:07: interested in that kind of a movie um
00:11:05 - 00:11:09: you know tops down
00:11:07 - 00:11:12: systems even though with lots of Digital
00:11:09 - 00:11:16: Data you could run a tops down syst
00:11:12 - 00:11:20: system less ineptly than
00:11:16 - 00:11:25: say the Soviets or the North Koreans did
00:11:20 - 00:11:27: but still the discovery process and the
00:11:25 - 00:11:30: price comparison that takes place
00:11:27 - 00:11:32: there's it is it is the fundamental way
00:11:30 - 00:11:36: things should be done but government has
00:11:32 - 00:11:38: to look for monopolies it has to create
00:11:36 - 00:11:40: the safety net you know you can argue
00:11:38 - 00:11:42: about the relative role of the
00:11:40 - 00:11:45: government in education and and health
00:11:42 - 00:11:50: care but they need to make sure that uh
00:11:45 - 00:11:53: everybody gets those Services right
00:11:50 - 00:11:54: you're looking fitter than I remember
00:11:53 - 00:11:56: seeing you the last yeah I know I've
00:11:54 - 00:11:59: been playing more tennis a little more
00:11:56 - 00:12:01: pickle ball uh it's because really
00:11:59 - 00:12:03: picking up that much it is in India in
00:12:01 - 00:12:06: North America it's unbelievable
00:12:03 - 00:12:07: particularly California Florida I mean
00:12:06 - 00:12:10: it's actually more people play
00:12:07 - 00:12:12: Pickleball now than play tennis right uh
00:12:10 - 00:12:15: so it's actually passed it
00:12:12 - 00:12:18: by uh the last time we met I kept
00:12:15 - 00:12:21: bugging you about what supplements do
00:12:18 - 00:12:24: you take now that you've gotten even
00:12:21 - 00:12:25: healthier looking is there any hack that
00:12:24 - 00:12:28: you would like to recommend to young
00:12:25 - 00:12:31: entrepreneurs I take vitamins you know
00:12:28 - 00:12:32: because it's there's no downside so
00:12:31 - 00:12:35: getting blood tests every once in a
00:12:32 - 00:12:36: while and seeing if there's anomalies uh
00:12:35 - 00:12:39: that's good and now there's a thing
00:12:36 - 00:12:42: called The Grail test um it's not
00:12:39 - 00:12:45: covered by all Insurance in the US so
00:12:42 - 00:12:50: probably not by much in India but if you
00:12:45 - 00:12:52: can afford it uh that is almost magical
00:12:50 - 00:12:55: at helping to see cancers way before
00:12:52 - 00:12:58: other techniques would catch
00:12:55 - 00:13:00: those uh so we have a foundation bill
00:12:58 - 00:13:01: which does work around climate it's
00:13:00 - 00:13:04: called rain
00:13:01 - 00:13:06: matter uh just for the sake of not
00:13:04 - 00:13:09: having this debate publicly let's
00:13:06 - 00:13:12: between us assume climate change is real
00:13:09 - 00:13:14: uh I've heard you speak about uh the
00:13:12 - 00:13:16: Breakthrough energy fund energy
00:13:14 - 00:13:18: transition appears to be a big
00:13:16 - 00:13:22: opportunity for young entrepreneurs to
00:13:18 - 00:13:26: work in over the next decade are there
00:13:22 - 00:13:29: any sub facets of that if I were a
00:13:26 - 00:13:31: 22-year-old boy or girl wanting to to
00:13:29 - 00:13:33: build a career in energy
00:13:31 - 00:13:36: transition uh where do you think there
00:13:33 - 00:13:40: are most Tailwinds what factor should I
00:13:36 - 00:13:44: focus on well because the sources of
00:13:40 - 00:13:48: emissions are so Broad and know we need
00:13:44 - 00:13:50: deep innovation in many many areas so
00:13:48 - 00:13:52: for electricity
00:13:50 - 00:13:55: generation you know we've got to make
00:13:52 - 00:13:58: solar cells better we have to make off-
00:13:55 - 00:14:01: win cheaper um there's probably
00:13:58 - 00:14:02: something dramatic that can happen in
00:14:01 - 00:14:04: nuclear
00:14:02 - 00:14:07: fision uh hopefully something dramatic
00:14:04 - 00:14:11: that can happen happen in nuclear fusion
00:14:07 - 00:14:13: uh in the long run that may be uh the
00:14:11 - 00:14:17: cheapest source of electricity now we
00:14:13 - 00:14:19: have some companies uh trying to get
00:14:17 - 00:14:24: there you know over in the agricultural
00:14:19 - 00:14:26: space um rice uh is a huge source of
00:14:24 - 00:14:29: emissions and there's new ideas about
00:14:26 - 00:14:32: genetics and direct seaing with house
00:14:29 - 00:14:35: you can vaccinate them change the
00:14:32 - 00:14:38: genetics uh in the industrial side you
00:14:35 - 00:14:41: can try to get cheap green hydrogen or
00:14:38 - 00:14:44: you can try and change the process for
00:14:41 - 00:14:47: example steel instead of using a form of
00:14:44 - 00:14:49: coal uh you could use electricity for
00:14:47 - 00:14:54: the reduction and
00:14:49 - 00:14:57: so I'd say there's probably 20 areas
00:14:54 - 00:15:01: that if you want to help in climate
00:14:57 - 00:15:04: Innovation uh these things are are
00:15:01 - 00:15:06: begging uh and I think it will be
00:15:04 - 00:15:08: startups and of course they'll have
00:15:06 - 00:15:11: tie-ups with big companies but the
00:15:08 - 00:15:12: open-mindedness most these breakthroughs
00:15:11 - 00:15:14: won't come straight out of the big
00:15:12 - 00:15:17: companies is there a starting point
00:15:14 - 00:15:20: though let's assume I have no Capital at
00:15:17 - 00:15:25: hand and I'm 22 starting off in
00:15:20 - 00:15:27: Bangalore uh how do I how do I go about
00:15:25 - 00:15:29: attempting to be a part of the energy
00:15:27 - 00:15:32: transition solution the ideal is
00:15:29 - 00:15:33: actually to find a philanthropist um
00:15:32 - 00:15:35: breakthrough energy has a fellows
00:15:33 - 00:15:39: program where we look for people with
00:15:35 - 00:15:41: really uh good early stage ideas and we
00:15:39 - 00:15:44: do that as a
00:15:41 - 00:15:46: grant uh with a little bit of of options
00:15:44 - 00:15:48: but you don't need a business plan then
00:15:46 - 00:15:51: if you get past that stage either on
00:15:48 - 00:15:53: your own or with the uh fellas type
00:15:51 - 00:15:55: Grant then there are Venture Capital
00:15:53 - 00:15:58: groups that really specialize in finding
00:15:55 - 00:16:03: Climate Technologies and they're willing
00:15:58 - 00:16:04: to fund very risky stuff um and I know
00:16:03 - 00:16:07: all of them including breakthrough
00:16:04 - 00:16:12: energy are like gosh are we missing some
00:16:07 - 00:16:14: in India and so now there's a network
00:16:12 - 00:16:16: you know if you have a good idea you
00:16:14 - 00:16:18: know if you pass it to me if non-one
00:16:16 - 00:16:20: pass it to me there's a bunch of us
00:16:18 - 00:16:23: Venture Capal and hopefully some who
00:16:20 - 00:16:26: would also come in domestically uh so
00:16:23 - 00:16:30: for risk Capital uh this is a very good
00:16:26 - 00:16:32: time if you have something that that
00:16:30 - 00:16:33: looks attractive could have a
00:16:32 - 00:16:36: significant
00:16:33 - 00:16:40: impact artificial general
00:16:36 - 00:16:41: intelligence uh you know more about this
00:16:40 - 00:16:45: than most
00:16:41 - 00:16:47: people how do you think Society changes
00:16:45 - 00:16:51: if you could paint a dystopian and a
00:16:47 - 00:16:54: utopian picture let's say there is Agi
00:16:51 - 00:16:59: what happens to the society post AGI
00:16:54 - 00:17:01: from a jobs what is money what is societ
00:16:59 - 00:17:04: what is family
00:17:01 - 00:17:10: standpoint well the amazing thing about
00:17:04 - 00:17:12: this technology is um we know it can
00:17:10 - 00:17:15: help uh in key areas we know it can
00:17:12 - 00:17:18: create like educational tutors lot of
00:17:15 - 00:17:21: great pilot work uh several projects
00:17:18 - 00:17:26: here in India Salon in the US is the one
00:17:21 - 00:17:29: that um may have started the 1 and is is
00:17:26 - 00:17:32: uh showing great results on that
00:17:29 - 00:17:36: so the potential is incredible and if if
00:17:32 - 00:17:39: we knew that all it did was make a lot
00:17:36 - 00:17:42: of jobs say three times more
00:17:39 - 00:17:45: productive so doctors are three times
00:17:42 - 00:17:47: more productive so you know the demand
00:17:45 - 00:17:49: for more people to see doctors and get
00:17:47 - 00:17:52: good advice that's probably good for
00:17:49 - 00:17:54: software um you know we'll still need
00:17:52 - 00:17:56: those software Engineers well we may
00:17:54 - 00:17:59: take some of the extra productivity for
00:17:56 - 00:18:04: Quality some for quantity but we're not
00:17:59 - 00:18:07: going to um you know start uh not not
00:18:04 - 00:18:11: needing software Engineers the fact that
00:18:07 - 00:18:14: over time and we don't know the the rate
00:18:11 - 00:18:16: of improvement um and there doesn't seem
00:18:14 - 00:18:20: to be an upper bound if it gets so that
00:18:16 - 00:18:23: it's a complete replacement that it can
00:18:20 - 00:18:25: do all the medical advice or it can do
00:18:23 - 00:18:29: all the coding that's a world of
00:18:25 - 00:18:31: excess where you know it's it's got to
00:18:29 - 00:18:34: be wonderful in the sense that you know
00:18:31 - 00:18:35: handicap people old people you're you
00:18:34 - 00:18:38: know taking care of them you're
00:18:35 - 00:18:41: shortening the the work week but you can
00:18:38 - 00:18:44: get to a point where the very organizing
00:18:41 - 00:18:48: principles of society uh and the whole
00:18:44 - 00:18:50: philosophy about you know what you value
00:18:48 - 00:18:52: um that world of excess which I
00:18:50 - 00:18:54: personally think won't come in the next
00:18:52 - 00:18:58: 20 years but I can't guarantee that you
00:18:54 - 00:19:00: know I was personally not expecting this
00:18:58 - 00:19:03: reading writing
00:19:00 - 00:19:06: breakthrough to take place just because
00:19:03 - 00:19:09: you know gpt3 got scaled up to
00:19:06 - 00:19:12: gp4 but that really showed something
00:19:09 - 00:19:16: profound in knowledge
00:19:12 - 00:19:18: representation uh had taken place and so
00:19:16 - 00:19:21: most of us are working on the hey let's
00:19:18 - 00:19:24: go build that tutor and that Health
00:19:21 - 00:19:28: advisor and farmer adviser um but while
00:19:24 - 00:19:31: we do that we should be aware that okay
00:19:28 - 00:19:35: so so much extra productivity
00:19:31 - 00:19:38: will uh surprise people and require us
00:19:35 - 00:19:42: to rethink uh about a lot of different
00:19:38 - 00:19:45: things so when Sam Alman was in India he
00:19:42 - 00:19:49: fielded a bunch of questions around chat
00:19:45 - 00:19:52: jpt and uh generative AI per se when
00:19:49 - 00:19:55: these large language models take as much
00:19:52 - 00:19:58: computational power as they require an
00:19:55 - 00:20:00: Indian entrepreneur who has lesser
00:19:58 - 00:20:04: access to Capital compared to a western
00:20:00 - 00:20:06: one how does an Indian entrepreneur
00:20:04 - 00:20:09: compete with the West in this domain
00:20:06 - 00:20:12: without the same kind of access you know
00:20:09 - 00:20:14: that's a very good question so if you're
00:20:12 - 00:20:16: an entrepreneur who's trying to build
00:20:14 - 00:20:20: foundational models models from the very
00:20:16 - 00:20:22: ground up like Google does or Microsoft
00:20:20 - 00:20:23: with opening eye does and they have four
00:20:22 - 00:20:26: five
00:20:23 - 00:20:30: others you have to raise you know two
00:20:26 - 00:20:32: three billion dollars uh now maybe some
00:20:30 - 00:20:34: government will decide because you're
00:20:32 - 00:20:37: domestic they'll help you do that or
00:20:34 - 00:20:40: provide some of that but there should
00:20:37 - 00:20:41: either be like zero one or two cases
00:20:40 - 00:20:45: where an Indian company goes after that
00:20:41 - 00:20:49: very base level uh and hopefully focuses
00:20:45 - 00:20:52: on some specific Indian applications of
00:20:49 - 00:20:55: that uh most of the
00:20:52 - 00:20:57: opportunity is at the level above you
00:20:55 - 00:21:00: know where you're saying okay let's take
00:20:57 - 00:21:03: this and help Architects or let's take
00:21:00 - 00:21:05: this and help this group of farmers or
00:21:03 - 00:21:07: you know the Indian legal system is very
00:21:05 - 00:21:09: different believe me
00:21:07 - 00:21:12: what legal things are done for the US
00:21:09 - 00:21:14: won't apply here but you know just
00:21:12 - 00:21:17: imagine if you could make everybody the
00:21:14 - 00:21:20: legal system four times more productive
00:21:17 - 00:21:22: you know that changes Justice because
00:21:20 - 00:21:26: right now the
00:21:22 - 00:21:29: backlog uh is kind of nightmarish um and
00:21:26 - 00:21:32: and here you know comes potential
00:21:29 - 00:21:35: solution so I'd say there's a thousand
00:21:32 - 00:21:38: opportunities where you you're you Pi
00:21:35 - 00:21:41: either pick or just use one of those
00:21:38 - 00:21:44: base level models but you're doing the
00:21:41 - 00:21:47: extra data value added user interface to
00:21:44 - 00:21:50: go after a particular application that I
00:21:47 - 00:21:52: think will is where we'll see the most
00:21:50 - 00:21:54: activity uh if somebody's bold enough to
00:21:52 - 00:21:56: say no I'm going after foundational
00:21:54 - 00:21:59: piece you know Screw you Bill Gates you
00:21:56 - 00:22:02: don't know I say hey good for you you
00:21:59 - 00:22:06: know I I could be wrong we are in you
00:22:02 - 00:22:08: know this is all very new uh stop are
00:22:06 - 00:22:11: there any arbitrages in place like a
00:22:08 - 00:22:14: unique Advantage India either by virtue
00:22:11 - 00:22:18: of population or the demographic
00:22:14 - 00:22:20: diversity has that that will help a
00:22:18 - 00:22:22: young entrepreneur focus on a particular
00:22:20 - 00:22:27: facet around building
00:22:22 - 00:22:30: this um or is there a legal Arbitrage is
00:22:27 - 00:22:31: regulation better here than that I think
00:22:30 - 00:22:35: it's very
00:22:31 - 00:22:38: possible that the health advice piece
00:22:35 - 00:22:41: that the US will over regulate that and
00:22:38 - 00:22:44: uh you know just see the the risk and
00:22:41 - 00:22:47: not not the benefit and that middle
00:22:44 - 00:22:49: income countries and I put India at the
00:22:47 - 00:22:51: top of the list will engage in a
00:22:49 - 00:22:54: dialogue and and drive very aggressively
00:22:51 - 00:22:59: to get the benefit but yes I would
00:22:54 - 00:23:02: expect uh definitely in Health
00:22:59 - 00:23:05: definitely in agriculture a lot of the
00:23:02 - 00:23:08: most exciting fast-moving things uh will
00:23:05 - 00:23:10: be here in India education I think
00:23:08 - 00:23:13: everybody's going to be doing it and and
00:23:10 - 00:23:16: including India I've seen this happen in
00:23:13 - 00:23:18: Indonesia do you think the business of
00:23:16 - 00:23:22: delivering medical advice and
00:23:18 - 00:23:24: prescribing people uh not with the human
00:23:22 - 00:23:27: on the other side but a model per se do
00:23:24 - 00:23:28: you think the potential for that is big
00:23:27 - 00:23:31: in India for young entrepreneurs to
00:23:28 - 00:23:35: focus on yes um you know there's going
00:23:31 - 00:23:39: to be a quality bar uh
00:23:35 - 00:23:41: and and yes and you know maybe at first
00:23:39 - 00:23:42: it's okay pregnant women or people
00:23:41 - 00:23:45: dealing with
00:23:42 - 00:23:46: diabetes um because it's easier than to
00:23:45 - 00:23:48: think through all the possible questions
00:23:46 - 00:23:52: and make sure the quality is right but
00:23:48 - 00:23:54: eventually you bet your your lifelong
00:23:52 - 00:23:58: medical agent that takes all your sensor
00:23:54 - 00:24:01: data and you know how you felt you know
00:23:58 - 00:24:05: when you eat this or drink that uh it'll
00:24:01 - 00:24:08: be there and it'll be reading the latest
00:24:05 - 00:24:12: literature um and it'll be super helpful
00:24:08 - 00:24:17: to you okay last question to you Bill if
00:24:12 - 00:24:22: you were 25 years old living in India uh
00:24:17 - 00:24:24: no no crazy skill set at hand and about
00:24:22 - 00:24:27: $100,000 of money to start a business
00:24:24 - 00:24:29: with what would you do today I'd
00:24:27 - 00:24:31: probably
00:24:29 - 00:24:36: build pick some AI
00:24:31 - 00:24:39: thing and just use the Google Microsoft
00:24:36 - 00:24:42: platforms and and go on top of that and
00:24:39 - 00:24:44: try and because I'd be in touch with the
00:24:42 - 00:24:45: customer so well and improving my data
00:24:44 - 00:24:49: keep
00:24:45 - 00:24:52: ahead um you know and I'd say okay who's
00:24:49 - 00:24:55: the most demanding customer for this uh
00:24:52 - 00:24:57: and go after that it might be fun you
00:24:55 - 00:24:59: know like clearing legal backlogs you
00:24:57 - 00:25:02: know that one kind of fast fascinates me
00:24:59 - 00:25:07: uh because it it's a mechanism that
00:25:02 - 00:25:09: helps all uh business activity um I'd
00:25:07 - 00:25:12: Envy the guys who get to work on the
00:25:09 - 00:25:14: foundation models I'd say damn uh even I
00:25:12 - 00:25:17: sort of Envy them because when I was
00:25:14 - 00:25:19: young I thought gosh you know when is AI
00:25:17 - 00:25:22: really going to make the
00:25:19 - 00:25:24: Breakthrough it took a lot longer uh
00:25:22 - 00:25:27: than I expected I'm glad now I get to
00:25:24 - 00:25:31: play a supportive uh role help shape it
00:25:27 - 00:25:33: a bit s uh engages me and now you know
00:25:31 - 00:25:36: we're using AI in our foundation work
00:25:33 - 00:25:39: and whether it's drug Discovery or all
00:25:36 - 00:25:42: these things uh so we can be way more
00:25:39 - 00:25:44: ambitious than we were before it came
00:25:42 - 00:25:47: along I happened to meet Satya and Sund
00:25:44 - 00:25:49: when I was in the US and uh we were
00:25:47 - 00:25:52: having dinner at a certain place
00:25:49 - 00:25:54: together and these guys seem to talk
00:25:52 - 00:25:57: about AG
00:25:54 - 00:25:59: AGI in a very precocious manner like
00:25:57 - 00:26:02: it's much closer than anybody is
00:25:59 - 00:26:04: thinking it is do you think that there
00:26:02 - 00:26:06: there could be one day when suddenly we
00:26:04 - 00:26:09: are surprised like a couple of years
00:26:06 - 00:26:13: down the line and there's so
00:26:09 - 00:26:17: much there's not really a really good
00:26:13 - 00:26:19: definition these models already today
00:26:17 - 00:26:21: when you have lots of lots of documents
00:26:19 - 00:26:24: you know more than a human could read in
00:26:21 - 00:26:27: lifetime it is able to find things and
00:26:24 - 00:26:28: reason across these documents in a
00:26:27 - 00:26:31: superhuman way
00:26:28 - 00:26:33: and so when you think about a lawsuit or
00:26:31 - 00:26:37: a drug filing you anything that gets to
00:26:33 - 00:26:40: be over say 10,000 Pages human cognition
00:26:37 - 00:26:43: even a great specialist person you got
00:26:40 - 00:26:46: 10,000 pages I dare you uh and these
00:26:43 - 00:26:48: things it's not just keyword search this
00:26:46 - 00:26:50: is semantic
00:26:48 - 00:26:53: representation of that level of
00:26:50 - 00:26:57: complexity so we're already
00:26:53 - 00:26:59: superhuman in a dimension that is kind
00:26:57 - 00:27:01: of surprising I mean I thought robots
00:26:59 - 00:27:04: you know would be taking over the
00:27:01 - 00:27:07: warehouse you know 10 years before
00:27:04 - 00:27:11: they'd be studying our legal and
00:27:07 - 00:27:13: Regulatory documents and we know that we
00:27:11 - 00:27:16: have Brute Force scale up we have a lot
00:27:13 - 00:27:19: of external algorithms you know to help
00:27:16 - 00:27:21: the AI know how hard to work I mean most
00:27:19 - 00:27:24: people don't realize
00:27:21 - 00:27:28: today it works exactly the same amount
00:27:24 - 00:27:31: where it puts out the next word
00:27:28 - 00:27:33: is and it doesn't think in advance it
00:27:31 - 00:27:37: doesn't think okay I have to write this
00:27:33 - 00:27:40: poem let me figure it all out no it it
00:27:37 - 00:27:43: it it's generating word by word and so
00:27:40 - 00:27:45: getting it to go faster when it's easy
00:27:43 - 00:27:48: or take more time like math problems you
00:27:45 - 00:27:50: know we we all laugh because it's
00:27:48 - 00:27:53: actually quite bad at certain type of
00:27:50 - 00:27:56: recursive math things like Sudoku
00:27:53 - 00:27:58: puzzles which are trivial uh in fact if
00:27:56 - 00:28:01: you say to the AI put this into
00:27:58 - 00:28:04: algebraic form and then give it to a
00:28:01 - 00:28:07: tiny little solver it's perfect but its
00:28:04 - 00:28:10: current algorithm is this single linear
00:28:07 - 00:28:12: pass print the most probable token
00:28:10 - 00:28:14: single and so there's a lot of control
00:28:12 - 00:28:17: architecture work that's been played
00:28:14 - 00:28:21: around with to deal with these quality
00:28:17 - 00:28:22: issues you know clearly humans we think
00:28:21 - 00:28:25: okay for this
00:28:22 - 00:28:27: problem it's just a joke blurt something
00:28:25 - 00:28:29: out uh they're asking me for medical
00:28:27 - 00:28:33: advice advice or marriage advice I
00:28:29 - 00:28:36: better you know really um think through
00:28:33 - 00:28:40: the implications and and so the control
00:28:36 - 00:28:44: system uh as well as the the extra scale
00:28:40 - 00:28:47: is going to drive improvements at you
00:28:44 - 00:28:50: know some rate that could be quite rapid
00:28:47 - 00:28:52: right no thank you so much bill for
00:28:50 - 00:28:55: having taken the time with me today and
00:28:52 - 00:28:59: uh look forward to seeing you in May
00:28:55 - 00:29:04: Califoria thank you
00:28:59 - 00:29:04: [Music]
00:29:06 - 00:29:16: hi guys we are in there today I'm trying
00:29:10 - 00:29:18: to fruit a new a very interesting guest
00:29:16 - 00:29:21: and
00:29:18 - 00:29:23: uh we're going to do something fun what
00:29:21 - 00:29:26: else we have for what else what else we
00:29:23 - 00:29:29: have for did you
00:29:26 - 00:29:31: know that your
00:29:29 - 00:29:36: [Music]
00:29:31 - 00:29:37: baby save us actually being serious did
00:29:36 - 00:29:40: you
00:29:37 - 00:29:43: know that your
00:29:40 - 00:29:46: baby would
00:29:43 - 00:29:51: something this is our beautiful
00:29:46 - 00:29:54: beautiful venue we have Mark that
00:29:51 - 00:29:55: Sheldon everyone's setting up lights
00:29:54 - 00:29:57: this is where everyone's going to be
00:29:55 - 00:29:59: sitting we're going to have a live
00:29:57 - 00:30:02: screen monitor here which I'll probably
00:29:59 - 00:30:06: be looking at a
00:30:02 - 00:30:09: boom broad mic and that's what we're
00:30:06 - 00:30:12: going to place on top of the two sers hi
00:30:09 - 00:30:15: Chan this the first time we working
00:30:12 - 00:30:18: together what are your
00:30:15 - 00:30:22: thoughts you don't look stressed at
00:30:18 - 00:30:25: [Music]
00:30:22 - 00:30:28: all that's called a skimo that we're
00:30:25 - 00:30:31: going to put over the guest that's our
00:30:28 - 00:30:34: spot and that's how big the schemmer is
00:30:31 - 00:30:36: I'm also worried about other things so
00:30:34 - 00:30:38: let's see then how it looks and then
00:30:36 - 00:30:42: take a b we're going to change the rose
00:30:38 - 00:30:42: it doesn't look so nice does it
00:30:44 - 00:31:06: [Music]
00:31:13 - 00:31:18: is that okay yeah that was
00:31:15 - 00:31:22: [Music]
00:31:18 - 00:31:26: fantastic how does it feel
00:31:22 - 00:31:29: good little bit a little bit more H say
00:31:26 - 00:31:29: something wait
