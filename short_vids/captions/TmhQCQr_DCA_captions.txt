00:00:00 - 00:00:01: Hi everyone, Kevin here.
00:00:01 - 00:00:07: Today I want to show you how you can 
use Microsoft Power BI. With Power BI,  
00:00:07 - 00:00:13: you can get insights from your data. When I worked 
at Microsoft, I used Power BI all the time to  
00:00:13 - 00:00:18: analyze how our businesses were performing 
and to make decisions on that performance.  
00:00:19 - 00:00:21: We're going to walk through 
a few different things today.
00:00:21 - 00:00:25: First off, I'm going to show you how you 
can both download and install Power BI.
00:00:25 - 00:00:30: It's entirely free to do. Then we're going 
to import some sample data into Power BI.
00:00:30 - 00:00:34: We're going to create some visualizations off 
of it, and what good would visualizations be  
00:00:34 - 00:00:39: and reports be, unless you could show it to 
others. We're going to save it, publish it,  
00:00:39 - 00:00:43: and then share it with others so they can 
get access to your visualizations as well.
00:00:44 - 00:00:48: This is going to be a 
high-level overview of Power BI,  
00:00:48 - 00:00:53: more of a 101 or introduction. If you want 
to see me go more in depth in Power BI,  
00:00:53 - 00:00:57: leave comments down below, leave some questions 
and I'll add them to my list of videos to create.
00:00:58 - 00:01:01: All right, well, why don't we jump 
on the PC and get started here.
00:01:01 - 00:01:06: Here I am on my PC and first off, I want to 
show you how you can download and install  
00:01:06 - 00:01:12: Power BI and to do that we're going to navigate 
to the following website. Now don't worry,  
00:01:12 - 00:01:17: you don't have to type in the website, instead you 
can click into the description of this video and I  
00:01:17 - 00:01:22: have a link to this website. Simply go ahead and 
click on there and that'll drop you on this page.
00:01:23 - 00:01:29: On this page, by far the easiest way to install 
Power BI and the way I'd recommend doing it,  
00:01:29 - 00:01:33: is clicking on the download free 
button. When you click on this,  
00:01:33 - 00:01:39: this will open up the Microsoft Store on the Power 
BI download page. If you haven't installed it yet,  
00:01:39 - 00:01:44: this text here will say install. Once you’ve 
installed it, you'll be able to launch it.
00:01:44 - 00:01:48: Now, once again, downloading 
Power BI desktop is entirely free.
00:01:48 - 00:01:50: You don't need an enterprise account,  
00:01:50 - 00:01:54: you don't need a commercial account, 
anyone can download Power BI Desktop.
00:01:54 - 00:02:00: The benefit of installing through the 
Microsoft Store is anytime Power BI updates,  
00:02:00 - 00:02:05: you automatically get those updates. Anytime 
any of the components change, the Microsoft  
00:02:05 - 00:02:10: Store will only download the pieces that change, 
so the updates should be pretty quick and easy.
00:02:10 - 00:02:14: And lastly, a nice added benefit 
is you don't have to be the admin  
00:02:14 - 00:02:19: logged onto your machine, you could be any 
user to go ahead and install Power BI Desktop.
00:02:20 - 00:02:24: This is one way you can download and install. If 
you prefer, there's also another option where you  
00:02:24 - 00:02:30: could click on see download or language options. 
When you click on this, this does not go through  
00:02:30 - 00:02:35: the Microsoft Store. Instead, you could download 
an EXE and then you could install it on your own.
00:02:35 - 00:02:39: So here on the page, you simply go ahead, 
choose the language that you want to install in,  
00:02:39 - 00:02:45: and then click on the download button. On the 
download page, you could either choose 64 bit  
00:02:45 - 00:02:50: or 32 bit depending on what type of system 
you're on and then go ahead and click next  
00:02:50 - 00:02:54: and it'll download an EXE that you can install 
on your machine.Those are the two ways you could  
00:02:54 - 00:03:00: install. Once again, I would recommend going with 
the first option where you click on download here.
00:03:00 - 00:03:04: Once you finish installing Power 
BI, let's go ahead and launch it.
00:03:04 - 00:03:07: You could go to your start 
menu and type in Power BI.
00:03:07 - 00:03:11: I also recommend pinning it to your 
taskbar for quick access in the future.
00:03:12 - 00:03:17: When you launch Power BI for the first 
time, you'll see this welcome screen appear  
00:03:17 - 00:03:21: and I want to take a moment to walk through 
it. Up here in the top left-hand corner,  
00:03:21 - 00:03:27: the most important thing you could do to 
get started is to get data. You can't create  
00:03:27 - 00:03:33: visualizations unless you have some data. You'll 
also see recent sources, so these are any other  
00:03:33 - 00:03:38: data sources that you've used in the past for 
quick access, and down at the bottom, if you've  
00:03:38 - 00:03:42: ever used Power BI before, you'll also be able 
to get back to reports that you've created.
00:03:42 - 00:03:46: Now, over on the right-hand 
side, Power BI provides  
00:03:46 - 00:03:50: a whole bunch of training content to get 
you up to speed on how to use Power BI.
00:03:51 - 00:03:54: Once you watch this video, if you still 
feel like you need some additional context  
00:03:54 - 00:03:59: or you need some additional tutorials, I 
highly recommend looking at this material.  
00:03:59 - 00:04:02: There are some awesome videos and also 
tutorials that you can run through.
00:04:03 - 00:04:08: Today what I want to do is I want to run 
through an example of the Kevin Cookie Company.
00:04:08 - 00:04:13: This is a fictional company that I created 
that I use in many of my different tutorials,  
00:04:13 - 00:04:18: and I want to show you how we could analyze some 
of the sales data for the Kevin Cookie Company.  
00:04:19 - 00:04:23: Before we get the data in Power BI, 
I want to just give you a preview  
00:04:23 - 00:04:27: of what the data looks like so you 
know what we're working with today.
00:04:27 - 00:04:31: First off, I have an Excel spreadsheet 
that contains a whole bunch of data.
00:04:31 - 00:04:35: It happens to be in Excel, but this 
could also be in, say, a SQL database,  
00:04:35 - 00:04:38: it could be a Kusto query 
that I run to get this output.
00:04:38 - 00:04:42: So just think of this as some data that I'm 
getting and it just happens to be an Excel  
00:04:42 - 00:04:47: spreadsheet just for simplification and 
also so you could follow along as well.
00:04:48 - 00:04:53: Within the Excel spreadsheet, I have a whole 
bunch of revenue, cost, and also profit data.
00:04:53 - 00:04:58: I'll just go through one row just so you have 
an idea of what type of data we're working with.
00:04:58 - 00:05:02: First off, I have sales in a number of different 
countries, so I have the country listed in a  
00:05:02 - 00:05:07: column, then I also have the product. We have a 
variety of products like chocolate chip cookies,  
00:05:07 - 00:05:12: oatmeal raisin and so on. We've sold a certain 
number of cookies in each of these markets,  
00:05:12 - 00:05:16: and I've listed out how many sales. You 
have the revenue for each type of cookie,  
00:05:16 - 00:05:22: the cost, the overall revenue, then we have 
the overall cost, and then you have the profit.
00:05:22 - 00:05:26: Then for the last few columns we 
also list out the date, the month  
00:05:27 - 00:05:29: and then also the year when these sales occurred.
00:05:29 - 00:05:33: So that's a quick view of what's in this 
spreadsheet, and I'm also going to pull in  
00:05:33 - 00:05:38: one other source of data into Power BI as 
well and it's going to come from the web.
00:05:38 - 00:05:43: Now there's a Wikipedia article here that 
lists out countries and also the population  
00:05:43 - 00:05:48: by the country. For my analysis in Power 
BI, I want to show all the countries where  
00:05:48 - 00:05:51: we have locations and I also want 
to align it with the population.
00:05:52 - 00:05:57: Once again, I have a link to this spreadsheet 
and link to this website URL on Wikipedia  
00:05:57 - 00:06:00: in the description, if you want 
to follow along with this example.
00:06:00 - 00:06:04: Now that we've taken a look at what type 
of data we're going to be working with,  
00:06:04 - 00:06:06: let's go ahead now and click on get data.
00:06:06 - 00:06:09: This brings up the get data dialog,  
00:06:09 - 00:06:14: and like I said before, there is an exhaustive 
list of places where you can get data from.
00:06:14 - 00:06:18: You can get data from a SQL database, 
from the web, from Kusto queries.
00:06:18 - 00:06:23: The list goes on and on. Chances 
are, if you have data somewhere,  
00:06:23 - 00:06:25: you'll be able to pull it into Power BI.
00:06:25 - 00:06:30: Today we're starting out with a simple example 
and we're just going to use a spreadsheet and  
00:06:30 - 00:06:35: it's an Excel spreadsheet, so I'll click 
on Excel and then click on connect. Next,  
00:06:35 - 00:06:40: this brings up the file picker and 
I see the file here on my desktop.  
00:06:40 - 00:06:42: If you're following along and 
you downloaded the spreadsheet,  
00:06:42 - 00:06:47: feel free to navigate to where you downloaded the 
spreadsheet and go ahead and then click on open.
00:06:47 - 00:06:52: This brings up the data navigator 
and I see my spreadsheet right here,  
00:06:52 - 00:06:57: the Kevin Cookie Company financials and within 
the spreadsheet it detected two different items.
00:06:58 - 00:07:02: One of them is the financials table 
and the other one is the cookie sales  
00:07:02 - 00:07:08: sheet. The cookie sales sheet is made up of 
only one table and that's the financials table.
00:07:08 - 00:07:11: So these two items are identical 
and I can choose either one.
00:07:11 - 00:07:15: In this case, I'm going to go ahead 
and check the box for cookie sales,  
00:07:15 - 00:07:18: and then I see all of my data 
over here on the right-hand side.
00:07:19 - 00:07:21: If I just wanted to continue at this point,  
00:07:21 - 00:07:25: I could go ahead and click on load 
and that would bring it into Power BI.
00:07:25 - 00:07:28: However, I want to transform the data first.
00:07:28 - 00:07:31: Now you might be wondering, well 
what does transform data mean?
00:07:31 - 00:07:34: In a sense, it allows me to modify my data  
00:07:34 - 00:07:39: and select what data I want to bring 
in before I bring it into Power BI.
00:07:39 - 00:07:41: So let's go ahead and click on transform data  
00:07:41 - 00:07:44: and I'll show you some of the 
changes I want to make to it.
00:07:44 - 00:07:48: This opens up the power query 
editor and this is where I'll  
00:07:48 - 00:07:52: be able to transform my data. Basically 
what I'm doing is I'm shaping the data  
00:07:52 - 00:07:56: and I'm building a data model from 
it, so let me show you what I mean.
00:07:56 - 00:08:00: So here you see the spreadsheet view again 
and I want to make a few different changes.
00:08:00 - 00:08:05: For instance, we have a bunch of different 
products we sell at the Kevin Cookie Company  
00:08:05 - 00:08:10: all the way from chocolate chip cookies to 
white chocolate macadamia nut cookies. We also  
00:08:10 - 00:08:15: sell fortune cookies; however, we've decided 
to cut this product line because in the past  
00:08:15 - 00:08:20: when we've looked at it, we've seen that the 
profitability of selling cookie Fortune cookies  
00:08:20 - 00:08:26: isn't that high, and it's been distracting us from 
our other products and our other business lines.
00:08:26 - 00:08:28: So I want to remove it from this analysis,  
00:08:28 - 00:08:32: so I'm going to go ahead now and uncheck 
fortune cookie and then click on OK.
00:08:32 - 00:08:37: So now by doing these changes, I'm 
starting to transform the data.
00:08:37 - 00:08:42: Now when I look over at units sold, you'll 
see that I also have some decimals here.  
00:08:42 - 00:08:47: For United States, chocolate chip cookie 
in one month, we sold 0.5 cookies.
00:08:47 - 00:08:49: Now that doesn't make any sense,  
00:08:49 - 00:08:54: and so I want to eliminate decimals from 
the data analysis that we're going to do.
00:08:54 - 00:08:57: And So what I'm going to do is I'm 
going to click on the unit sold column.
00:08:57 - 00:09:00: We're going to right click on it, and 
then I want to click on change type  
00:09:00 - 00:09:04: and I'm going to go ahead and make 
all of these just whole numbers.
00:09:04 - 00:09:08: Next, as I look through my table here, one 
other thing that doesn't quite make sense,  
00:09:08 - 00:09:10: if I go over to the right-hand side,  
00:09:10 - 00:09:15: I say month name. Instead of saying month 
name, I could be a little more concise.
00:09:15 - 00:09:17: So I'm going to just double click on 
this column header and I'm going to get  
00:09:17 - 00:09:21: rid of month name and we're just 
going to call this column month.
00:09:21 - 00:09:26: As I go through and I make all of these changes, 
over on the right-hand side, you'll see this  
00:09:26 - 00:09:32: section called applied steps. These are all the 
different transformations I'm making to the data.
00:09:32 - 00:09:36: So let's say that maybe I made a change and 
I didn't really intend to make that change,  
00:09:36 - 00:09:42: I can remove that step. So here is an example. 
You see this filtered row. If I click in here,  
00:09:42 - 00:09:46: I could see what I filtered. Here 
I filtered out Fortune cookies.
00:09:47 - 00:09:51: Now I don't want to just eliminate fortune 
cookies altogether because it was something  
00:09:51 - 00:09:56: we were selling and I probably should include 
it in our visualizations that we're making, so  
00:09:56 - 00:10:00: on second thought, let me go ahead and keep 
it. So what I could do is I could click  
00:10:00 - 00:10:06: this X and then I could delete that step and 
that'll remove that transformation to my data.
00:10:06 - 00:10:10: All of this data looks pretty good 
now and I feel good about it and  
00:10:10 - 00:10:12: I'm ready to bring this into Power BI.
00:10:12 - 00:10:16: One thing I want to do though, before I 
bring this data in is I also want it to  
00:10:16 - 00:10:20: bring in population for these different countries.
00:10:20 - 00:10:25: To do that, I'm going to go up to the top ribbon 
and I'm going to click on new source and this  
00:10:25 - 00:10:30: data is coming from the web. Now once again, I 
could click on more and that'll bring up the same  
00:10:30 - 00:10:34: data source dialogue that we saw earlier, 
but I also see Web highlighted here,  
00:10:34 - 00:10:37: so I'm going to click here because 
that's easier to pull this up.
00:10:37 - 00:10:43: This brings up the From Web dialogue and what 
I'm going to do here is it asks me for the URL,  
00:10:43 - 00:10:48: so I'm going to go ahead and paste 
the Wikipedia site URL within here  
00:10:48 - 00:10:51: and once I paste it in, I'm going 
to go ahead and click on OK.
00:10:51 - 00:10:56: Similar to before, this also brings 
up the navigator, and here I can see  
00:10:56 - 00:10:59: all the different elements 
that are on the Wikipedia page.
00:10:59 - 00:11:03: I'm going to click on this first one, 
the sovereign States and dependencies  
00:11:03 - 00:11:08: and here I see all of the data, all of the 
countries with the associated population.
00:11:08 - 00:11:15: This is exactly what I want. Now this is really 
cool that if you find the table on some website,  
00:11:15 - 00:11:19: you can pull that in as a 
data source into Power BI.
00:11:19 - 00:11:23: Once I'm satisfied with this table and 
everything looks good, I'm going to click on OK.  
00:11:23 - 00:11:27: Over on the left-hand side, now you 
see that I have two different queries,  
00:11:27 - 00:11:31: one of them is or my cookie sales 
and the other one is the Wikipedia  
00:11:31 - 00:11:35: article. I'm going to right click on this 
and give it a name that makes more sense.
00:11:35 - 00:11:40: I titled it country populations 
and simplified the name somewhat.  
00:11:40 - 00:11:44: And here within this table I don't need 
all of this data, so similar to before,  
00:11:44 - 00:11:49: I'm also going to transform the data that appears 
here. For instance, I don't need the percent of  
00:11:49 - 00:11:54: world population, so I'm going to go ahead and 
remove this column. I don't need the date and  
00:11:54 - 00:12:00: I also don't need the source to appear either 
and I don't care so much for the rank either.
00:12:00 - 00:12:05: All I want is the country name and then the 
associated population. For the Kevin Cookie  
00:12:05 - 00:12:11: Company, we only have locations in a few of these 
countries, do I don't need to bring all this data  
00:12:11 - 00:12:16: in for all these different places, so once again 
I'm going to transform the data even more. So I'm  
00:12:16 - 00:12:21: going to click on this dropdown and I'm going to 
filter it down to only the countries I care about.
00:12:21 - 00:12:29: So I'm going to type in Canada, France, Germany, 
Mexico and the last one is the United States.
00:12:29 - 00:12:33: Once I enter in all my different 
countries where we have locations,  
00:12:33 - 00:12:38: I'm going to go ahead and click on OK and here I 
see the five countries where we have locations.
00:12:39 - 00:12:44: Now it's not quite done because here I see 
United States and there's a D after it.
00:12:44 - 00:12:48: So one thing I'm going to do is right click 
on this and I'm going to replace the value  
00:12:48 - 00:12:54: and the replaced value will remove the 
D and then I'm going to click on OK,  
00:12:54 - 00:12:57: and similarly for France I'm going 
to go ahead and do the same thing.
00:12:58 - 00:13:02: Now I have my list of countries 
and I also have the population  
00:13:02 - 00:13:07: associated with those countries.The next 
thing that I want to do is I want to connect  
00:13:07 - 00:13:11: this data here or this table 
with my cookie sales table.
00:13:11 - 00:13:17: Right now they're both independent tables and 
I want to be able to associate the two of them  
00:13:17 - 00:13:21: or to join them, and to do that, I'm going 
to click into the cookie sales table.
00:13:21 - 00:13:26: I'm going to go up to merge queries and I want to 
connect it based on the country name. So I'm going  
00:13:26 - 00:13:31: to select the country name here and my cookie 
sales data and then in my country populations,  
00:13:31 - 00:13:36: I'm going to connect it based on the country 
name. It asks me about privacy. I'm going to  
00:13:36 - 00:13:40: ignore privacy checks for now. This is just 
Kevin Cookie Company, so I'm not too worried.
00:13:40 - 00:13:45: I'll go ahead and save that, and it looks 
like every single row in my Kevin Cookie  
00:13:45 - 00:13:51: Company table has a match with populations 
and I'm going to go ahead and click OK. Over  
00:13:51 - 00:13:54: on the right-hand side, now you see 
in cookie sales it's added a column.
00:13:54 - 00:13:59: Let me go ahead and click on this filter 
option and I want to see the population.
00:13:59 - 00:14:05: So I'm going to click on OK and now here for 
every row within the Kevin Cookie Company data,  
00:14:05 - 00:14:08: I see a population associated with that country.
00:14:09 - 00:14:10: All of this looks good.
00:14:10 - 00:14:11: I brought in my spreadsheet.
00:14:11 - 00:14:17: I brought in data from Wikipedia and I connected 
the Wikipedia data to my cookie sales data,  
00:14:17 - 00:14:22: so I'm pretty satisfied now. I don't need to 
make any other changes and the next thing I  
00:14:22 - 00:14:27: do now is over here in the top left-hand 
corner, let's click on close and apply.
00:14:27 - 00:14:33: Now that we've created our data models, 
Power BI drops us on a blank canvas.
00:14:33 - 00:14:38: I want to take a moment to walk through 
and orient you to where we are right now.
00:14:39 - 00:14:45: Right here in the center of the page, this big 
blank area, this is called the report editor.
00:14:45 - 00:14:48: This is the canvas where we're 
going to create all of our visuals,  
00:14:48 - 00:14:51: so think things like charts or tables or maps.
00:14:51 - 00:14:56: All of those will go within this space 
here. Over on the right-hand side,  
00:14:56 - 00:14:58: these are all of our fields.
00:14:59 - 00:15:04: And so you'll recognize the Kevin Cookie sales 
and then all of our columns appear within here,  
00:15:04 - 00:15:10: and similarly I have another table for the country 
population, so all of those are called fields.
00:15:11 - 00:15:15: Basically, it's all of the data that 
we have and that we could build visuals  
00:15:15 - 00:15:19: off of. Right to the left of that, 
there's another pane called visuals.
00:15:19 - 00:15:23: These are all the different 
types of visuals we can build  
00:15:23 - 00:15:26: using the data over in fields or from this pane.
00:15:26 - 00:15:28: Now that we've looked at visualizations,  
00:15:28 - 00:15:31: I also want to show you what's 
over here on the left-hand side.
00:15:32 - 00:15:37: Over here, the first view and the default 
view that we drop in is the report view.
00:15:37 - 00:15:40: This is where we're going 
to build all of our visuals.
00:15:40 - 00:15:43: Underneath that you have another option for data,  
00:15:43 - 00:15:46: and if I click on that you'll see the 
yellow indicates the view that I'm in.
00:15:46 - 00:15:50: This is a view of all of my data, so once again  
00:15:50 - 00:15:53: this is the same type of view as what 
we saw in the spreadsheet earlier.
00:15:53 - 00:15:57: Although it's all been transformed 
now based on the earlier step.  
00:15:58 - 00:16:02: Over here on the right-hand side, I can see 
my fields again, and I could jump between  
00:16:02 - 00:16:06: the different data or underlying 
data that I have here in Power BI.
00:16:07 - 00:16:11: Then over on the left-hand side, 
there's a third option called model.
00:16:11 - 00:16:14: These are all of my different 
relationships between my data.
00:16:14 - 00:16:20: I'm going to go ahead and expand this. If I hover 
over, you'll see this line connects my 2 tables.
00:16:20 - 00:16:23: One of them is my cookie sales, the 
other is my country populations.
00:16:23 - 00:16:28: When I hover over this line, you see 
that I related or joined these tables  
00:16:28 - 00:16:32: based on the country name and 
so that's why those two items  
00:16:32 - 00:16:36: highlight. Let's go back and click into 
report and let's go ahead and start  
00:16:36 - 00:16:40: building some visualizations to help us 
make decisions based on our business data.
00:16:40 - 00:16:44: The first thing I want to do is I have 
this blank canvas and I should give a  
00:16:44 - 00:16:48: little bit of context when people look at 
this report. So what I'm going to do is when  
00:16:48 - 00:16:53: I click on the home option on the ribbon, 
there's an option to insert a text box.
00:16:53 - 00:16:57: I'm going to click on that and let 
me insert a title for this report  
00:16:57 - 00:17:01: and maybe I'll go ahead and call this the 
Kevin Cookie Company performance report.
00:17:01 - 00:17:05: I typed in the name. Let me make 
it a little larger just so it helps  
00:17:05 - 00:17:07: frame the entire report 
that we're going to create,  
00:17:07 - 00:17:12: and I'm going to go ahead and expand it 
so it spreads across the entire report.
00:17:12 - 00:17:18: OK, we have the title on here, things are looking 
good, but we need to get some visualizations in.
00:17:18 - 00:17:22: The first thing I want to look at 
is what was our profit by date.
00:17:24 - 00:17:27: To go over to the right-hand pane on the side,  
00:17:27 - 00:17:33: and I'm simply going to click on profit. 
Now Power BI pulls in a default bar chart.
00:17:33 - 00:17:36: It predicted that this was the most 
likely one that I wanted to use.
00:17:36 - 00:17:41: We could still change that, though if it doesn't 
align exactly with what we wanted to create,  
00:17:41 - 00:17:43: and I also want to align it up with the date.
00:17:43 - 00:17:47: So I'm also going to click on date 
over here within the fields pane.
00:17:47 - 00:17:53: Now I see it shows it by year 
so in 2018 we had about $650,000  
00:17:53 - 00:17:58: of profit. When I hover over the item, I 
see a tooltip that shows me the exact value.
00:17:58 - 00:18:01: And when I hover over 2019, I 
see that we had a little over  
00:18:01 - 00:18:05: $2,000,000 worth of profit. 
Over on the right-hand side,  
00:18:05 - 00:18:10: let's say that I want to see the profit data 
not by year, but I want to see it by the month.
00:18:10 - 00:18:13: So what I could do is I'm going 
to click on this drop down,  
00:18:13 - 00:18:17: and instead of doing date hierarchy, 
I'm going to switch it to date  
00:18:17 - 00:18:21: and now this will show me the month-by-month 
and year view of what profit was like.
00:18:21 - 00:18:26: Now bar chart works OK for this type 
of analysis, but I actually prefer  
00:18:26 - 00:18:31: a line chart and to do that I simply 
go up here in the visualization pane  
00:18:31 - 00:18:35: and I can click on line chart and 
that'll switch the type of this chart.
00:18:35 - 00:18:37: Now this looks pretty good. I'm 
going to go ahead and just make  
00:18:37 - 00:18:41: it a little bit smaller and 
then move it up on my report.
00:18:41 - 00:18:43: So here now I could see my profit by date.
00:18:44 - 00:18:50: When we look over at visualizations, you'll see 
a few other things. Here in the axis, Power BI  
00:18:50 - 00:18:55: automatically identified that the date should 
be the axis and the profit should be the values.
00:18:55 - 00:18:57: Now you can move things around as you see fit.
00:18:57 - 00:19:00: You could also add things to the 
legend if you want to do that.
00:19:00 - 00:19:02: You can even add secondary values here.  
00:19:02 - 00:19:05: So you can define what the 
different elements of the chart are.
00:19:05 - 00:19:10: The next thing that I want to do is I want 
to create a view of all of the geographies  
00:19:10 - 00:19:14: where we have locations and I also want 
to see the profit by those geographies.
00:19:15 - 00:19:18: To do that, first off I'm 
going to click on country.
00:19:18 - 00:19:23: Now here too, Power BI identifies that 
it's country data and it automatically  
00:19:23 - 00:19:26: inserts the map visualization.
00:19:26 - 00:19:27: And here you see a map now.
00:19:27 - 00:19:34: Now I see dots where I have locations, but I want 
to see profit data by those different countries  
00:19:34 - 00:19:39: and so here too what I could do is I'm going to 
click on profit and I can even drag that over,  
00:19:39 - 00:19:45: drop it on my map and now I see visuals that 
represent how much profit by country. So here  
00:19:45 - 00:19:50: it looks like North America, Canada, and also 
France all had about the same amount of profit,  
00:19:50 - 00:19:55: while Germany and Mexico are smaller dots 
indicating that there was less profit there.
00:19:55 - 00:20:00: I could also once again if I want to switch 
the type of view, I can switch it to a tree map  
00:20:00 - 00:20:04: and here I can see profit 
by country this way as well.  
00:20:04 - 00:20:08: So here once again I could see which country 
had the most profit all the way down to which  
00:20:08 - 00:20:12: country had the least, and now it turns out 
most of these countries are pretty similar,  
00:20:12 - 00:20:16: but here I get the sense of what was the 
most all the way down to what was the least.
00:20:16 - 00:20:18: I'm going to switch back to the map view.
00:20:18 - 00:20:20: The next thing I want to do is  
00:20:20 - 00:20:25: insert a table that'll show me the population 
and then the units sold for that population.
00:20:25 - 00:20:27: So here I'm going to click on table.
00:20:27 - 00:20:28: This will insert a table.
00:20:28 - 00:20:32: Now when I click on the visualization 
first without selecting any of the data,  
00:20:32 - 00:20:34: it'll simply insert a blank table.
00:20:34 - 00:20:36: Let me pull it up here.
00:20:36 - 00:20:41: I could easily drag and drop things around 
to organize my report how I see fit.  
00:20:41 - 00:20:44: Here what I'm going to do is I'm 
going to pull in the population,  
00:20:45 - 00:20:50: so here I have a field for population, country 
population.Let's go ahead and drop that in  
00:20:51 - 00:20:53: and then I also want to pull 
in the different countries.
00:20:53 - 00:20:56: Now I can see the country, the 
population for that country.  
00:20:56 - 00:21:01: The next thing I want to do is also how many 
units were sold for each of those countries.
00:21:02 - 00:21:07: Here now I have a table and let me go 
ahead and I'll position country first.
00:21:07 - 00:21:11: So here now I can see the country, 
what the population of the country is,  
00:21:11 - 00:21:15: and I can also see how many 
units were sold for that country.
00:21:15 - 00:21:19: Now, a little beyond what we're going to do 
today, but some of the things you could do.
00:21:19 - 00:21:21: You could also insert calculated fields,  
00:21:21 - 00:21:24: so you could do things like per 
capita, how many cookies did we sell?
00:21:24 - 00:21:28: You could do those types of calculations 
given the data that you have existing,  
00:21:28 - 00:21:30: but that's above and beyond 
what we're doing today.
00:21:30 - 00:21:33: The last thing I want to do is insert a bar chart  
00:21:33 - 00:21:37: and for the bar chart I want 
to look at sales by product.
00:21:37 - 00:21:42: So let's go ahead and I'm going to click 
on the blank report again, and here I'm  
00:21:42 - 00:21:47: going to click on product and next I want to 
click on the profit for each of the products.  
00:21:48 - 00:21:53: And let's go ahead and change the type 
and I'm going to go with a bar chart.
00:21:53 - 00:21:56: Here you see a simple bar chart that 
I inserted and it shows me all of the  
00:21:56 - 00:22:00: product names and the associated 
profit for each of those products,  
00:22:00 - 00:22:04: so here I can see that chocolate 
chip cookies generated the highest  
00:22:04 - 00:22:08: amount of profit and then the Fortune 
cookies generated the least amount of profit.
00:22:08 - 00:22:12: Now that I've inserted all of these 
different visuals into my report,  
00:22:12 - 00:22:14: it's also very easy to slice the data.
00:22:14 - 00:22:18: So here I can bring in a 
slicer. I'm going to insert that  
00:22:18 - 00:22:22: and then I'm going to drag and drop 
the country name on the slicer.
00:22:22 - 00:22:25: So here if I just want to view data for the 
United States, I could click on the United  
00:22:25 - 00:22:31: States and you'll see that all the visuals 
now adjust to reflect just that country.
00:22:31 - 00:22:35: Similarly, I could click on Mexico and that'll 
shift to Mexico and I could go through and slice  
00:22:35 - 00:22:41: my data by country. So very quickly I could see 
my profit by date by country, I could see the  
00:22:41 - 00:22:46: population and then I could also see which product 
was the most profitable very quickly simply by  
00:22:46 - 00:22:52: selecting the market. Another way I could also 
slice the data is rather than inserting a slicer,  
00:22:52 - 00:22:56: I could also click into my different visuals. So 
here if I click on the map on the United States.  
00:22:57 - 00:23:03: This too also serves as a quick way to slice 
my data, so here I could just see Germany data,  
00:23:03 - 00:23:06: I could see France data, or 
here I could see Mexico data.  
00:23:06 - 00:23:11: So very quickly I can adjust my, 
I can very quickly slice my data.  
00:23:11 - 00:23:15: Here if I just click on the map in let's 
say a random area like the Atlantic Ocean,  
00:23:15 - 00:23:20: it will then turn on all the different countries 
again. Even in the table too, I could click on a  
00:23:20 - 00:23:26: country here and that'll filter it by that country 
and once again I could go ahead and undo it.
00:23:26 - 00:23:29: I have a whole bunch of really valuable 
information in this report now.  
00:23:29 - 00:23:32: I also want to show you how you 
can change the look and feel of it.
00:23:32 - 00:23:37: This report doesn't look all that great, so let 
me go ahead and see how I could change this.  
00:23:38 - 00:23:41: If I go up to the ribbon and 
I click on view under themes,  
00:23:41 - 00:23:45: I have all these different 
themes that I can apply now.
00:23:45 - 00:23:49: Maybe the executive theme would be a nice one, 
so let me click on executive and here you'll  
00:23:49 - 00:23:53: notice that the colorw changed and it looks 
a little bit more professional in my opinion.
00:23:54 - 00:23:58: I can also adjust the look of my different 
visuals that I have within this report,  
00:23:58 - 00:24:03: so if I click on the visual 
over here under visualizations,  
00:24:03 - 00:24:07: the initial view is the field view. 
But here I could click on format.
00:24:07 - 00:24:10: It kind of looks like a paint roller, 
and if I click into that, I can adjust  
00:24:10 - 00:24:15: all these different elements of the visual. For 
instance, let's say I wanted to make the title  
00:24:15 - 00:24:20: a little bit bigger, I could click on title and 
then I could go ahead and increase the text size,  
00:24:20 - 00:24:24: and so maybe I make it a 20-point font 
just so it stands out a little bit more.
00:24:24 - 00:24:26: Maybe I want to call out this 
one and I could go through and  
00:24:26 - 00:24:28: modify the titles on the other ones as well.
00:24:29 - 00:24:33: All-in-all, with these different tools 
that you have under the format tool,  
00:24:33 - 00:24:39: you could go ahead and get the visuals to match 
your company or your business’ brand and look  
00:24:39 - 00:24:44: and feel. Feel free to go ahead and play around 
with it and get it to how you want it to look.
00:24:44 - 00:24:48: I've gone through and I have this report. It 
looks pretty good if I wanted to add, say,  
00:24:48 - 00:24:54: additional pages to my report, I could also go in 
and I could add more pages. I could also go ahead  
00:24:54 - 00:24:59: and rename this page if I wanted to, but for 
now I think page one, that sounds fine. Once  
00:24:59 - 00:25:04: I'm done making all of my edits, I want to go 
ahead and save this and to save it I'm going  
00:25:04 - 00:25:09: to click on file save as and let me go ahead 
and for now I'll save a copy on my desktop.
00:25:09 - 00:25:14: I'm going to call this Kevin Cookie 
Company Report and then click on save.
00:25:14 - 00:25:17: Now I can use this on my own just 
fine. I could analyze the data,  
00:25:17 - 00:25:21: I can create different views on my 
data and I can work in isolation.
00:25:21 - 00:25:25: But really, the power of Power 
BI comes from being able to work  
00:25:25 - 00:25:29: with others and being able to publish 
reports so other people can see it,  
00:25:29 - 00:25:33: and other people can interact with 
the different views that you created.  
00:25:33 - 00:25:38: To share the report with others, first we need 
to publish it, so let's go up to the file menu.
00:25:38 - 00:25:41: We're going to go down to publish and 
then we're going to publish to Power BI.
00:25:42 - 00:25:47: The Power BI service is what houses all of these 
different reports that we publish, so I'm going  
00:25:47 - 00:25:52: to go ahead, let's click on Power BI, and it says 
do you want to save your changes? I'll go ahead  
00:25:52 - 00:25:57: and save the changes again before I publish, 
and then it asks me to choose a destination.
00:25:57 - 00:26:00: I'm going to go ahead and select my workspace.
00:26:02 - 00:26:07: Look at that! It looks like it was successful 
at saving it to the Power BI service. Now what  
00:26:07 - 00:26:13: I could do is if I click on open Kevin Cookie 
Company Report pbix, I could open it in Power BI.
00:26:13 - 00:26:18: Let's go ahead and open it and see what this 
looks like. This will open up the Power BI  
00:26:18 - 00:26:24: service and here I can see my Kevin Cookie 
Company report on powerbi.com and here too I  
00:26:24 - 00:26:29: could go ahead and filter the data just like 
I did in the Power BI desktop application.
00:26:30 - 00:26:34: The nice thing about putting it on the web is 
if I want other people to come in and to see  
00:26:34 - 00:26:40: my visuals that I created, I can go up to the 
top right-hand corner and I can click on share.
00:26:40 - 00:26:44: This opens up the share dialog and I 
have all sorts of different options here.
00:26:44 - 00:26:48: I can go ahead and grant access to different 
individuals by entering in their email address.
00:26:48 - 00:26:52: I could also go ahead and I can allow 
them to share the report with others.  
00:26:52 - 00:26:56: I can let them create new content 
based on the underlying datasets,  
00:26:56 - 00:27:01: and I can send an email notification and if 
I make any changes it'll include it for them.
00:27:01 - 00:27:05: So here I could define what the permissions 
are when I share this with other people.
00:27:05 - 00:27:11: All right, well, that was a quick look at 
how you can get started using Power BI.
00:27:11 - 00:27:13: Once again, that was a high-level overview.
00:27:13 - 00:27:17: If you want to see me go deeper into 
Power BI, leave comments down below.
00:27:17 - 00:27:22: Let me see what else you'd like me to jump into 
and I'll add it to my list of videos to create.
00:27:22 - 00:27:25: If you found this video helpful, 
please give it a thumbs up.
