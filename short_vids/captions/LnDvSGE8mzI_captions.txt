00:00:26 - 00:00:34: I went shopping at the supermarket and came back 🏠
00:00:35 - 00:00:44: I'm trying to cleanse my body.
I'm going to make vegetable-based recipes this week
00:00:47 - 00:00:56: I'm going to take a shower, get some rest, and then I'm going to make dinner.
00:01:08 - 00:01:16: I'm going to make a dish that looks like meat.
00:01:22 - 00:01:29: I heated tofu in the microwave for 3 minutes to shorten the cooking time
00:01:33 - 00:01:38: 4g hijiki (seaweed)
00:01:44 - 00:01:47: 30g carrot
00:02:01 - 00:02:05: 15g yam
00:02:14 - 00:02:20: Edamame are scrubbed with salt and lightly pre-cooked
00:02:27 - 00:02:36: One packet of dashi soup stock can make about 400ml of soup stock.
So I can make miso soup with the broth that I don't use.
00:03:01 - 00:03:07: Separate 100ml of dashi stock
00:03:35 - 00:03:42: Use 40 grams of edamame.
And freeze the rest.
00:03:51 - 00:03:59: I hear it tastes better if I strain the tofu.
00:04:07 - 00:04:13: Boil carrot and hijiki together quickly
00:04:24 - 00:04:30: When potatoes are soft, dissolve miso and miso soup is ready
00:04:38 - 00:04:43: Soak ingredients in 100ml of soup stock
00:04:47 - 00:04:52: 1/2 teaspoon salt, 2 teaspoons soy sauce, 2 teaspoons mirin (sweet cooking wine)
00:04:54 - 00:05:00: Add 15 g grated yam
00:05:10 - 00:05:14: 1 egg, 1 teaspoon potato starch
00:05:27 - 00:05:32: Drain ingredients and add
00:06:31 - 00:06:37: Deep fry at 160-170 degrees Celsius
00:07:03 - 00:07:06: Soy sauce and ginger
00:07:20 - 00:07:26: crispy and fluffy inside
and the fried ganmodoki (Simmered Deep-fried Vegetable Tofu) is even better!
00:07:29 - 00:07:35: I made more to put in oden. (Japanese stew)
I'm looking forward to eating oden too 🤤
00:07:38 - 00:07:42: (drink after the tea leaves sink 🍵 lol)
00:08:14 - 00:08:22: I shower and re-fold the towels that have fallen off the shelf
00:08:52 - 00:08:57: I wanted to eat lotus root and burdock root
00:09:00 - 00:09:06: I'm going to slice it thinly and make chips
00:09:26 - 00:09:31: I will soak them in vinegar water
00:09:32 - 00:09:37: The rest of the lotus root is soaked together
00:09:39 - 00:09:43: The rest of the burdock root is cut into strips
00:09:50 - 00:09:56: 10 g ginger, peeled and coarsely chopped
00:10:14 - 00:10:20: 2 green onions cut into small pieces
00:10:37 - 00:10:44: The recipe calls for horse mackerel, but I couldn't find it on the market, so I'm going to substitute sardines.
00:10:45 - 00:10:52: If I use a mixer, the smell will remain.
I'll try my best to make it fine somehow with a knife 😹
00:10:53 - 00:10:58: 1 tablespoon each of potato starch and miso
(This recipe is for half a large horse mackerel)
00:11:18 - 00:11:24: I'll freeze the rest of the lotus root, since it seems to be freezable
00:11:41 - 00:11:51: I think it is better to throw away the oil after  frying once.
but it's a waste, so I'll use it one more time 😹
00:11:57 - 00:12:03: I boil 500ml of water in a small pot
00:12:58 - 00:13:04: When water comes to a boil, roll the fish balls with  spoons
00:13:07 - 00:13:13: Half the leftover vegetables are put together to the pot
00:13:29 - 00:13:35: Once it's cooked
I separate some for the oden that I'm looking forward to 🍢 
00:13:46 - 00:13:51: 1 tablespoon light soy sauce
00:13:52 - 00:13:56: I added 1/2 teaspoon kombu dashi (kelp dashi) because the taste was too weak
00:13:58 - 00:14:03: Turn off the heat, add green onion and sudachi, and it's done.
00:14:05 - 00:14:10: Root vegetable chips on top of potherb mustard and arugula for a salad
00:14:13 - 00:14:18: I used olive oil, ponzu, and wasabi for the dressing
00:14:31 - 00:14:37: Sardine tsumire ( fish meatball)  is made with sardine bones and skin, so it has a rich taste!
00:14:43 - 00:14:51: The salad has a good texture and aroma.
I'm glad I didn't overcook it because I could have eaten as much as I wanted 😹
00:14:55 - 00:15:00: I thought the small bones would bother me, but I chopped them up well so they were smooth 🐟
00:15:15 - 00:15:22: Today is the day of oden which I was looking forward to😹💗
00:15:23 - 00:15:30: It was cold, so I'm going to take a bath and cook later
00:15:48 - 00:15:54: Preparing from soup stock with dashi packet today too
00:15:57 - 00:16:02: Satsuma-age (deep‐fried minced fish and vegetables)  on a skewer in a recipe book looks delicious, so I'm going to try to copy it
00:16:17 - 00:16:23: I hollowed out a hanpen (floated-type kamaboko) in a Halloween mold.
00:16:25 - 00:16:29: Make fluffy ghosts👻
00:16:33 - 00:16:37: Make rice balls with leftover edamame until the broth boils
00:16:39 - 00:16:44: A little sesame oil and salted kelp
00:17:04 - 00:17:10: 1 tablespoon each of soy sauce and sake (cooking wine)
00:17:11 - 00:17:18: I heard that freezing daikon makes it easier to absorb the flavor, so I tried it.
00:17:23 - 00:17:32: Onigiri was very lonely, so I added green onion and sesame 😂
00:18:19 - 00:18:25: Tomatoes are a pain so I put them in with the skin on 🍅
00:18:31 - 00:18:35: I freeze two onigiri and eat them at a later date
00:18:41 - 00:18:46: I forgot the important boiled egg
00:19:49 - 00:19:56: I made oden quickly without pre-boiling it.
I think it was the most delicious oden I have ever made😹
00:19:58 - 00:20:01: The rice balls and the various ingredients were a good match.
00:20:03 - 00:20:11: With dipping miso  given as a gift
00:20:15 - 00:20:21: The daikon radish was not broken, but the inside was soaked with flavor.
I was surprised at how different it was when frozen.
00:20:23 - 00:20:29: Both miso sauce and karashi mustard are so good, I'm not sure which one to choose with every bite... 😹
00:20:31 - 00:20:37: Why does oden warm me up so much?
00:20:39 - 00:20:44: I feel like taking another shower🚿
00:21:10 - 00:21:17: The box I had ordered for had arrived
00:21:29 - 00:21:35: I applied for a service to store my clothes in a warehouse
00:21:36 - 00:21:43: I put as many clothes as I can fit in this bag (up to 10) 
and they'll clean my clothes and keep them in the warehouse for 6 months.
00:21:46 - 00:21:53: I'm going to leave 10 pieces of clothing, mostly summer dresses
00:21:54 - 00:22:01: They going to clean each of them and
I will be able to leave them there for 6 months because they will take a picture of them and put it my page on the Internet.
00:22:04 - 00:22:11: Once I've packed my bags and gone through the online process, all I have to do is wait for pickup.
00:22:23 - 00:22:30: I'm hungry today, so I'm going to make a quick meal right away
00:22:36 - 00:22:41: I was lured by the catchphrase "Surprisingly easy to cook".
I bought these shiso seeds at the supermarket.
00:23:03 - 00:23:11: After removing the fruit, wash it well and dry it.
00:23:23 - 00:23:29: Tonight's dinner is a simple noodle dish
00:23:35 - 00:23:41: Add a little sugar and salt to the eggs
00:23:52 - 00:23:55: Heat the sesame oil
00:24:12 - 00:24:20: As soon as I add the egg mixture, turn off the heat and stir
00:24:26 - 00:24:31: Boil thin Chinese noodles
00:24:43 - 00:24:50: Put them in cold water with ice
00:25:06 - 00:25:13: Boil mirin (sweet sake) to remove alcohol
00:25:14 - 00:25:20: Add soy sauce in the same quantity as mirin.
(I made it by 100ml each)
00:25:22 - 00:25:30: boil down to make kaeshi (Japanese seasoning)
00:25:39 - 00:25:46: I let the kaeshi sit for a few days and when it thickens, it's done.
But I'm just going to pour it on 😂
00:25:46 - 00:25:51: (The day after this it became thickened kaeshi 🤤💛)
00:25:59 - 00:26:05: Here's the dinner that was ready in no time
00:26:08 - 00:26:12: I was surprised to find that it tasted better than I expected when well mixed with the other ingredients.
00:26:13 - 00:26:19: It's not often that I have Chinese noodles on hand.
I would love to make this again as long as I have eggs, cucumbers and Chinese noodles to make it with.
00:26:27 - 00:26:33: I heard that I should dry shiso seeds for about half a day.
I don't want to carry it over to tomorrow, so I'll do it today lol
00:26:38 - 00:26:43: 100g shiso seed and 1 tablespoon salt
00:26:50 - 00:26:54: Mix well and put into a sterilized jar.
00:26:57 - 00:27:02: I couldn't find the right jar, so I filled one I had, but it was too big 😅
00:27:06 - 00:27:13: I put olive oil until the shiso seed is covered with olive oil.
and put it in the fridge for at least a day and it's done!
00:27:45 - 00:27:52: I had to go to the hospital to get some prescription drugs, and it took a long time, so
I decided to spend some time in a cafe
00:27:57 - 00:28:01: It's a lovely cafe with three floors
00:28:11 - 00:28:16: Lovely mousse cake 🍰
00:28:26 - 00:28:32: It's nice to have a dark cafe at night to relax ☕
00:28:34 - 00:28:40: It's cold outside, so I need to warm myself up with a cup of tea and get out...
00:28:56 - 00:29:02: I feel chilled to the core by the cold rain⛄ lol
00:29:08 - 00:29:15: I'm going to make a quick meal and eat it because I'm afraid I'm going to fall asleep.
00:29:27 - 00:29:34: An easy-to-make recipe I wanted to try on a cold, late day
00:29:38 - 00:29:43: I'm going to make it from soup stock again today
00:29:53 - 00:29:59: I wanted to put myoga in it, but I couldn't find it in the market.
so I bought a condiment set.
00:30:11 - 00:30:18: The shiso leaves are also used as a topping.
00:30:23 - 00:30:35: 600ml soup stock, 60ml mirin, 90ml white soup stock (white colored dashi)
00:31:00 - 00:31:08: I whipped the egg whites until they were stiff 😅
00:31:13 - 00:31:19: 1 1/2 tablespoons each of potato starch and water
00:31:40 - 00:31:47: Boil the somen noodles
00:32:12 - 00:32:17: (The recipe shows a finish where the egg whites are more mixed with the sauce 😂)
00:32:20 - 00:32:26: I put the egg yolk and frozen cod roe on top to let them melt in the residual heat
00:32:49 - 00:32:55: I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but the a little hard texture went well with the sweet sauce 💗💗
00:32:57 - 00:33:05: It was also good that it was thickened so it didn't get cold easily and could be eaten hot!
00:33:06 - 00:33:13: The cod roe defrosted naturally and was ready to eat 😂
00:33:26 - 00:33:31: It's still a quiet morning in the city
00:33:33 - 00:33:42: I met up with a friend at 8:00 a.m.
We are here for breakfast.
00:33:45 - 00:33:51: Breakfast set at a bakery.
I feel like I'm about to start a good day 🥐💛
00:34:11 - 00:34:17: I got some chestnuts boiled in astringent skin, handmade by my friend's mother🥺
00:34:18 - 00:34:22: Bread available in one piece, I'm happy 🍞
00:34:28 - 00:34:33: Walking, cafe, walking, cafe...
00:34:37 - 00:34:41: We came to sushi for an early dinner 🍣
00:34:42 - 00:34:48: It's a concept of a standing style sushi restaurant where young artisans are making sushi!
00:34:52 - 00:34:58: There's a water heater on the counter and I order from my phone📲
00:35:00 - 00:35:05: What a nice new experience and a nice holiday!
00:35:47 - 00:35:54: I ate sushi at 4:00 p.m.
We were talking about we may be hungry before bed.
00:35:56 - 00:36:03: I made  shiso seed oil.
I feel like I need to make pasta with it and eat it (my excuse)
00:36:08 - 00:36:16: It's my day off so I decided to eat and then go to bed 🙄😂
00:36:26 - 00:36:33: I'm going to make it with about 2 tablespoons
00:36:58 - 00:37:04: I made it with what I had on hand.
I also added arugula if I felt like it.
00:37:13 - 00:37:20: Aroma of garlic and
and fresh shiso flavor like basil.
00:37:31 - 00:37:38: I bought a new cheese grater, and it's a very good purchase because I don't have to put a lot of effort into it.
00:37:47 - 00:37:52: I made too much for a nighttime meal 😅
(I ate it all in one sitting though)
00:37:57 - 00:38:03: I really liked the texture and aroma of the shiso seeds 🤤
00:38:24 - 00:38:29: Hearty homemade astringent 🌰💗💗
00:38:34 - 00:38:37: I was so happy with my astringent peelings that I sent a picture to my family
00:38:38 - 00:38:44: I used to make it all the time, but, I will stay healthy and I'll make it next year!
And my grandmother said
00:38:45 - 00:38:51: I thanked my friend's mother even more for inspiring even my grandmother 😂💗
00:39:17 - 00:39:23: The large chestnuts were so satisfying and slightly sweet.
It was a delicious treat that warmed my heart 🤤
00:39:41 - 00:39:48: I'm going to prepare dinner early today and spend the rest of the evening relaxing.
00:40:05 - 00:40:11: I'm going to make potato salad with potatoes, carrots, and onions
00:40:33 - 00:40:37: Boil with a teaspoon of sugar.
00:41:27 - 00:41:33: I wanted to use the egg yolk but accidentally cracked it open😅
00:41:38 - 00:41:44: 1 teaspoon salt, 2 tablespoons vinegar
00:41:47 - 00:41:52: I was out of mayonnaise and I thought I could make it with what I had, so I decided to make it
00:41:55 - 00:42:00: I didn't expect to use so much oil 😂
(1 cup)
00:42:06 - 00:42:13: Add a little at a time and mix well
00:42:26 - 00:42:31: I was very impressed with homemade mayonnaise.
00:42:43 - 00:42:49: Put the potatoes back in the pot and shake them to dry them out.
00:42:53 - 00:42:59: Carrots I forgot to boil with potatoes.
I have to boil it again 😓
00:43:04 - 00:43:09: 4 tablespoons mayonnaise
00:43:15 - 00:43:20: Well-drained onion, cucumber and carrot
00:43:22 - 00:43:28: 1 teaspoon each of vinegar and mustard paste, salt and pepper
00:43:46 - 00:43:51: The rest of the carrots are used for mushrooms and soup
00:44:00 - 00:44:06: It's almost Halloween, so I dress up the mushrooms 💀
00:44:12 - 00:44:19: I'm going to shape the fish paste into a jagged shape
00:44:40 - 00:44:45: Wrap the fish paste and the cucumber with nori.
00:44:56 - 00:45:04: Sushi rice mixed with tobiko to make it orange
00:45:12 - 00:45:18: Cucumber, rice, cucumber, rice
00:45:20 - 00:45:25: Kamaboko・ rice
00:45:28 - 00:45:34: I put one more layer of nori because I didn't have enough nori.
00:45:48 - 00:45:54: While it sits for 10 minutes to blend, we make the soup.
00:45:57 - 00:46:03: Just simmer the consomme soup stock packet and vegetables
00:46:12 - 00:46:16: Season with salt and it's ready in no time
00:46:45 - 00:46:48: Put cucumbers on top to look like 🎃
00:46:54 - 00:47:00: The soup tastes even better than it looks 🤤 
00:47:02 - 00:47:08: Tobiko (small pieces of tobiko) are a nice accent to the sushi rolls!
The potato salad was smooth and tasty too!
00:47:19 - 00:47:24: I found a Halloween bath bomb at Lush, where I was lured by the aroma!
00:47:46 - 00:47:56: Next to the Halloween items, Christmas items are on display
I even feel that the end of the year is quickly approaching.
00:48:12 - 00:48:18: Thank you for watching to the end!
