00:00:01 - 00:00:06: we believe in various myths to make 
sense of reality and rationalize the  
00:00:06 - 00:00:11: systems we live in for thousands of years 
we believed in the divine right of kings  
00:00:12 - 00:00:18: often you will find that the dominant ideologies 
of society conveniently fit the economic interests  
00:00:18 - 00:00:23: of those who are at the top of that society's 
hierarchy people's own egos often play a strong  
00:00:23 - 00:00:28: role in maintaining these myths it's not 
exactly comforting to realize that so much  
00:00:28 - 00:00:34: of what you are taught is nothing but a lie 
it is often easier to get people to believe  
00:00:34 - 00:00:38: myths than it is to convince them that their 
way of thinking is already based on myths  
00:00:39 - 00:00:44: one of the most common myths in today's political 
discourse that for some reason still hasn't died  
00:00:44 - 00:00:51: out is the notion of the deficit the narrative 
that governments need to balance the budget and  
00:00:51 - 00:00:57: that the so-called national debt is an impending 
catastrophe there is a lot of unfounded hysteria  
00:00:57 - 00:01:04: surrounding the national debt especially in 
countries like the united states canada australia  
00:01:04 - 00:01:09: and the uk many people in countries like these 
still believe that their governments are flat  
00:01:09 - 00:01:14: broke and that their budget is unable to tackle 
some of the most important issues of our time  
00:01:14 - 00:01:20: whether the policy debate is about health care 
infrastructure high-speed rail education housing  
00:01:20 - 00:01:25: or a green new deal to combat the impending 
climate catastrophe the same question inevitably  
00:01:25 - 00:01:32: arises how are you gonna pay for it where will you 
get the money you want people to have homes how  
00:01:32 - 00:01:37: can we afford that you want to invest trillions of 
dollars into climate change program to transition  
00:01:37 - 00:01:43: to a sustainable economy to mitigate the impending 
climate crisis but what about the deficit  
00:01:43 - 00:01:49: how are we gonna find the monies it's not 
like money grows in the federal reserve  
00:01:49 - 00:01:55: i mean trees isn't the u.s national debt 
like 12 trillion or 28 trillion or something  
00:01:56 - 00:02:02: won't future generations have to pay back the debt 
that the government created in its own currency  
00:02:03 - 00:02:09: a lot of people unironically think this way even a 
lot of politicians believe this myth and the ones  
00:02:09 - 00:02:14: who secretly do know that the deficit is just a 
mythical boogeyman have to keep pretending that  
00:02:14 - 00:02:19: it's real either because they don't want you to 
know that you are indeed capable of demanding  
00:02:19 - 00:02:24: nice things from the government or because the 
deficit myth is already so deeply ingrained into  
00:02:24 - 00:02:29: the political unconscious that politicians are 
scared to challenge it sometimes politicians lie  
00:02:29 - 00:02:36: about the deficit as a talking point to perpetuate 
the myth of fiscal responsibility and use it as  
00:02:36 - 00:02:41: an excuse to push for austerity or shut down 
progressive policies that the corporate donors  
00:02:41 - 00:02:47: won't like and often the politicians themselves 
are ignorant enough to actually believe the myth  
00:02:47 - 00:02:53: the deficit hysteria is not just unfounded 
bologna it is a highly dangerous myth that  
00:02:53 - 00:02:58: holds back human progress the way that many people 
talk about the deficit today is comparable to how  
00:02:58 - 00:03:04: flat earthers talked about and still talk about 
the sun and the earth before copernicus but i  
00:03:04 - 00:03:09: feel like many of us intuitively know that there 
is something wrong with the deficit narrative and  
00:03:09 - 00:03:13: the way people think about it as many of the 
holes in the narrative are quite easy to spot  
00:03:14 - 00:03:19: why is a deficit only brought up when it comes to 
spending on social programs how come politicians  
00:03:19 - 00:03:25: don't ask how can we pay for it when they push for 
multi-trillion dollar wars bailing out the banking  
00:03:25 - 00:03:31: sector we're giving billion dollar tax cuts to the 
wealthy which all add massively to the deficit why  
00:03:31 - 00:03:37: do conservative politicians always fear monger 
the most about the deficit despite historically  
00:03:37 - 00:03:42: running the most deficits hell even washington 
insiders like dick cheney admitted that deficits  
00:03:42 - 00:03:47: don't matter unless you are drinking the kool-aid 
of ideology on the daily you can easily spot the  
00:03:47 - 00:03:53: clear contradictions in all of this but we are not 
given the means to articulate it this video will  
00:03:53 - 00:03:59: provide you with the necessary means to absolutely 
destroy the deficit argument when you encounter it  
00:03:59 - 00:04:03: while many of the deficit hawk talking 
points could easily be disproved just by  
00:04:03 - 00:04:08: old-school Keynesian economics and many economists 
today who are not total conservative ideologues  
00:04:08 - 00:04:13: usually understand that governments don't 
operate like households the main economic school  
00:04:13 - 00:04:18: of thought which has by far the most rigorous 
and encompassing analysis of the deficit myth  
00:04:18 - 00:04:24: and how the modern monetary system in general 
works is what is now called "Modern Monetary Theory"
00:04:24 - 00:04:30: also known as MMT for short contrary to the 
dogma spouted by conservative deficit duds  
00:04:30 - 00:04:37: and libertarian goldbug fanatics mmt is not just 
printing money and it is not even a prescriptive  
00:04:37 - 00:04:42: policy ideology it's almost misleading 
to call Modern Monetary Theory a theory  
00:04:42 - 00:04:48: because it's really more just a description of how 
the modern monetary system actually works based on  
00:04:48 - 00:04:52: facts that are very hard to disprove once you 
understand them those who critique it without  
00:04:52 - 00:04:58: first actually bothering to engage in the material 
itself usually do so because mmt invalidates some  
00:04:58 - 00:05:04: of their ideological assumptions while many 
of the ideas in modern monetary theory are not  
00:05:04 - 00:05:11: particularly new and derived from keynesianism mmt 
provides a more well-articulated and updated lens  
00:05:11 - 00:05:15: for understanding the modern monetary system 
and gets some key insights into the origin  
00:05:15 - 00:05:22: of money and taxes from fields that are outside 
economics as well such as history and anthropology  
00:05:22 - 00:05:26: now i don't want to name drop too many unfamiliar 
names but it is worth giving a shout out to the  
00:05:26 - 00:05:33: economists most known for popularizing mmt such as 
warren mosler larry randall ray bill mitchell and  
00:05:33 - 00:05:39: most recently stephanie kelton and her wonderful 
book the deficit myth key works and lectures  
00:05:39 - 00:05:43: from all of these economists can be found in the 
description of this video for further learning if  
00:05:43 - 00:05:49: you are interested but i will try to give you a 
concrete picture of the main ideas in this video  
00:05:49 - 00:05:54: so it is accessible as possible once you 
understand the key realities of how the modern  
00:05:54 - 00:05:59: monetary system actually works the mythology 
surrounding the deficit discourse will be  
00:05:59 - 00:06:05: demystified and you will go absolutely mad trying 
to watch the backward discourse on the deficit  
00:06:05 - 00:06:11: that is so heavily polluted by this deficit 
mythology but first what even is the deficit  
00:06:11 - 00:06:18: and the national debt the deficit is simply a 
subtraction of two numbers how much money the  
00:06:18 - 00:06:24: government puts into the economy subtracted by how 
much is taken out of the economy the national debt  
00:06:24 - 00:06:29: is simply the all-time record of how much money 
the fed put into the economy minus how much it  
00:06:29 - 00:06:36: subtracted out of it via taxation that's it the 
national debt may look scary but in reality no  
00:06:36 - 00:06:42: citizens are gonna have to pay for it and no one 
ever will and that's okay what matters is not how  
00:06:42 - 00:06:49: big the deficits are but rather who the deficits 
are benefiting is the deficit being used for wars  
00:06:49 - 00:06:54: and corporate bailouts or is it being used to 
fund things like affordable housing good quality  
00:06:54 - 00:07:00: public transportation universal health care and 
tuition-free college future generations if they  
00:07:00 - 00:07:05: are lucky enough to survive climate change won't 
have to worry about paying off the national debt  
00:07:05 - 00:07:10: but they will have to worry about paying off their 
private student debt and their private mortgage  
00:07:10 - 00:07:16: debt as well as the impending climate crisis 
coincidentally conservative deficit hawks don't  
00:07:16 - 00:07:22: seem to care very much about any of these things 
while this may be obvious if you didn't drink the  
00:07:22 - 00:07:28: conservative kool-aid growing up for most of us 
we have to unlearn first in order to see the truth  
00:07:28 - 00:07:33: to deprogram the deficit ideology that is 
so deeply ingrained into the public psyche  
00:07:33 - 00:07:39: so let's demystify it one step at a time the 
first step to deconstructing the deficit myth  
00:07:39 - 00:07:45: is understanding that governments are not like 
households even though we hear this analogy  
00:07:45 - 00:07:51: all the time we often hear politicians say that 
governments must get their fiscal house in order  
00:07:51 - 00:07:58: that the government must tighten its belt and that 
the government is living beyond its means this is  
00:07:58 - 00:08:03: a completely backward way to think even though 
it works as a personal narrative to simplify  
00:08:03 - 00:08:09: reality in people's heads many people have the 
tendency to apply their microeconomic thinking  
00:08:09 - 00:08:14: of private business and personal households to the 
macroeconomics of the government and the overall  
00:08:14 - 00:08:21: economy after all if households ran continuous 
deficits like virtually all governments do then  
00:08:21 - 00:08:26: most people would be bankrupt but in reality 
governments do not function like households  
00:08:26 - 00:08:33: which should be quite evident unless your brain 
is swimming in ideology contrary to popular belief  
00:08:33 - 00:08:39: governments with currency sovereignty cannot run 
out of money i repeat governments with currency  
00:08:39 - 00:08:44: sovereignty cannot run out of money even though 
you probably never thought much about this before  
00:08:44 - 00:08:50: something deep down inside of you intuitively 
already knows this basic truth governments with  
00:08:50 - 00:08:55: currency sovereignty are the monopoly issuer 
of their currency but just remember that this  
00:08:55 - 00:09:00: fiscal freedom only applies to governments 
that have their own currency and have most  
00:09:00 - 00:09:06: of their debt in that currency governments with 
currency sovereignty include the united states  
00:09:06 - 00:09:13: canada the uk australia china japan and a few 
others keep these countries in mind because all of  
00:09:13 - 00:09:18: what is being said in this video is applicable to 
countries with currency sovereignty even though i  
00:09:18 - 00:09:24: will be mostly referring to the united states as a 
primary example for simplicity's sake because most  
00:09:24 - 00:09:29: people are familiar with us politics the arguments 
of modern monetary theory apply to countries like  
00:09:29 - 00:09:36: this where the government is the monopoly issuer 
of a fiat currency and is not on a gold standard  
00:09:36 - 00:09:42: so this does not apply as much to countries 
in the european union who have to use the euro  
00:09:42 - 00:09:47: and rely on the european central bank or to 
countries which do have their own currency  
00:09:47 - 00:09:54: but hold much of their debt in a foreign currency 
such as venezuela argentina and lebanon these  
00:09:54 - 00:09:59: countries do not have currency sovereignty the 
notion that governments with currency sovereignty  
00:09:59 - 00:10:04: cannot run out of money has become an irrefutable 
fact ever since most of the world abandoned the  
00:10:04 - 00:10:11: gold standard which was formally abandoned on an 
international level under richard nixon in 1971  
00:10:11 - 00:10:17: but the usa abandoned the gold standard 
multiple times most notably in 1933 under fdr  
00:10:17 - 00:10:21: for those who don't know the gold standard 
constrained the ability of governments to  
00:10:21 - 00:10:26: create currency as an equivalent amount of gold 
reserves had to be held in proportion to the  
00:10:26 - 00:10:32: amount of money stored gold is a finite resource 
and the gold standard system proved to not make  
00:10:32 - 00:10:38: very much sense as governments had to spend 
more and more to maintain the capitalist system  
00:10:38 - 00:10:43: so the united states finally abandoned the gold 
standard officially under richard nixon and most  
00:10:43 - 00:10:49: other countries did the same afterwards ever since 
then governments who issue their own fiat currency  
00:10:49 - 00:10:55: and impose taxes in that currency spend in that 
currency and issue debt in that currency can never  
00:10:55 - 00:11:00: run out of money the government will always 
be able to make all payments as they come due  
00:11:00 - 00:11:06: so any payment that it has promised to make 
whether it's your social security retirement pay  
00:11:06 - 00:11:11: wars military spending government programs or 
interest payments to government bonds denominated  
00:11:11 - 00:11:17: in its own currency then the government can always 
make those payments the way it used to work is  
00:11:17 - 00:11:22: that governments would actually print up that 
currency or stamp the coins to make the payments  
00:11:22 - 00:11:27: but today it's mostly handled electronically so 
it's a bit misleading to say that governments  
00:11:27 - 00:11:33: print money governments create most of their 
money virtually via their central bank by typing  
00:11:33 - 00:11:38: numbers onto a screen without boring you with 
the nitty-gritty details the way it basically  
00:11:38 - 00:11:44: works now in the usa for example is that the us 
treasury spends by having the federal reserve  
00:11:44 - 00:11:49: the central bank credit the reserves of a 
commercial bank and that bank credits the accounts  
00:11:49 - 00:11:54: of the appropriate recipients of the government 
spending the various actors that the government  
00:11:54 - 00:12:01: needs to carry out a certain policy voila money 
created on a computer with nothing but a keystroke  
00:12:02 - 00:12:07: while many politicians probably won't admit 
this all of the chairmen of the federal reserve  
00:12:07 - 00:12:15: the people supervising the money creation will 
the united states can pay any debt it has because  
00:12:15 - 00:12:20: we can always print money there is an infinite 
amount of cash at the federal reserve we print  
00:12:20 - 00:12:25: it digitally so we you know we as a central 
bank we have the ability to create money the  
00:12:25 - 00:12:31: banks have um accounts with the fed much the same 
way that you have an account in a commercial bank  
00:12:31 - 00:12:37: so to lend to a bank we simply use the computer 
to mark up the size of the account that they  
00:12:37 - 00:12:42: have with the fed technically the central bank is 
formally considered independent in most countries  
00:12:42 - 00:12:48: but in reality it essentially functions as the 
government's bank the government effectively  
00:12:48 - 00:12:53: decides what the central bank's objectives are 
and of course it finances much of the federal  
00:12:53 - 00:12:58: government's policies by crediting commercial 
banks and the appropriate accounts to those who  
00:12:58 - 00:13:04: need to carry out the policy this common method 
of fed money creation is not to be confused with  
00:13:04 - 00:13:10: quantitative easing also known as qe which is a 
less common policy that a lot of people falsely  
00:13:10 - 00:13:16: equate with money printing qe is when the central 
bank purchases longer-term securities from the  
00:13:16 - 00:13:22: market in order to increase the money supply 
and encourage lending and investments now we  
00:13:22 - 00:13:25: don't have time to get into the technicals of 
qe but if you want to understand the difference  
00:13:25 - 00:13:30: between money printing and quantitative easing 
the channel money and macro has a really good  
00:13:30 - 00:13:36: video about it that i highly recommend now back to 
fed money creation let's use one more example to  
00:13:36 - 00:13:41: illustrate how federal governments with currency 
sovereignty finance most of their policies  
00:13:41 - 00:13:46: while this essentially works in a very similar way 
for every country with currency sovereignty let's  
00:13:46 - 00:13:51: take the uk as another example to visualize just 
in case you still don't get it when parliament  
00:13:51 - 00:13:56: approves the budget parliament gets the central 
bank the bank of england in this case to credit  
00:13:56 - 00:14:02: the bank accounts of the institutions and the 
individuals necessary to make that policy happen  
00:14:02 - 00:14:07: and there you have it now that the budget has 
been approved new money has just been created and  
00:14:07 - 00:14:12: entered the private sector if you still aren't 
convinced and think that it just can't be so  
00:14:12 - 00:14:17: simple then i would highly recommend checking out 
the statements from the central banks themselves  
00:14:17 - 00:14:23: the bank of england for instance published a paper 
in 2014 that clearly outlined this process of how  
00:14:23 - 00:14:28: money is created and you can also find countless 
statements from those who worked as chairman of  
00:14:28 - 00:14:33: the federal reserve in the united states as 
referenced throughout this video the proof is  
00:14:33 - 00:14:39: in the pudding by now an alarm bell in your brain 
is probably going off isn't government spending  
00:14:39 - 00:14:44: supposed to be financed by taxation where does the 
money come from it has to come from the taxpayer  
00:14:44 - 00:14:51: right isn't that what taxes are for to finance 
government spending as counter-intuitive as it  
00:14:51 - 00:14:58: sounds taxes do not fund government spending 
what taxes don't fund government spending  
00:14:59 - 00:15:06: nope taxes do not fund the majority of government 
spending at least not on a federal level local and  
00:15:06 - 00:15:11: provincial governments on the other hand who 
cannot create money do use taxes to finance  
00:15:11 - 00:15:17: much of their expenditures while also relying on 
federal government handouts to finance the rest  
00:15:17 - 00:15:21: which is usually created by newly created 
government money by the central bank  
00:15:21 - 00:15:26: but in general the federal government does 
not rely on taxpayers to spend money for the  
00:15:26 - 00:15:32: federal government spending comes first and the 
taxes come later the taxes are not to finance  
00:15:32 - 00:15:37: the spending it's the truth that many economists 
know and even some politicians know it but because  
00:15:37 - 00:15:42: most of the electorate doesn't know it political 
representatives have to keep pretending that it's  
00:15:42 - 00:15:47: somehow possible for the government to run out of 
money and of course it works as a quite convenient  
00:15:47 - 00:15:53: talking point for politicians to use as an excuse 
to privatize public assets and social programs  
00:15:53 - 00:16:02: the state has no source of money other than the 
money people earn themselves there is no such  
00:16:02 - 00:16:10: thing as public money that is only taxpayers money 
margaret thatcher is wrong or flat out lying did  
00:16:10 - 00:16:14: it ever occur to these squareheads where the money 
originally came from and who creates the currency  
00:16:15 - 00:16:20: a stubborn conservative might say well doesn't 
the government get all of its money from taxes  
00:16:20 - 00:16:25: according to this logic there is no public 
money there is only people's money which the  
00:16:25 - 00:16:31: government uses then the question you should 
ask them is where do taxpayers get their money  
00:16:31 - 00:16:37: well they earn them through wages paid by their 
firms that they work at ok then how do the firms  
00:16:37 - 00:16:42: get money consumers purchasing their products 
or services with the money that they earn from  
00:16:42 - 00:16:48: the firms that they work at as you can see if you 
believe the delusion that the taxpayer is at the  
00:16:48 - 00:16:53: center of government spending then you get into a 
never-ending cycle that can never explain how the  
00:16:53 - 00:17:00: currency originally got into the economy content 
check what the bank note says next time you get  
00:17:00 - 00:17:06: some dollar bills it will say bank of england if 
you are in the uk or federal reserve note if you  
00:17:06 - 00:17:11: are in america take a moment to think about it if 
the government really needed your taxpayer money  
00:17:11 - 00:17:16: to finance the spending then virtually every 
government would not be running continuous  
00:17:16 - 00:17:21: budget deficits by always spending more into the 
economy than it takes out of it by now you might  
00:17:21 - 00:17:26: be thinking to yourself if governments don't 
rely on taxpayer money for federal spending  
00:17:26 - 00:17:32: then what even is the purpose of taxation 
why bother with taxes at all the answer might  
00:17:32 - 00:17:37: surprise you and you will find out towards the 
end of the video as seen in the time stamps but  
00:17:37 - 00:17:42: first let's address the common misconception that 
government deficits are financed by borrowed money  
00:17:45 - 00:17:50: a common rebuttal to what i have said so far 
would be if the federal government issues its  
00:17:50 - 00:17:55: own currency and can create money digitally 
out of thin air then why does it issue debt  
00:17:55 - 00:18:01: in the form of bonds doesn't this mean 
that the government is borrowing our money  
00:18:01 - 00:18:05: most governments such as the usa do allow 
people to purchase government bonds in  
00:18:05 - 00:18:10: exchange for interest payments which the 
central bank pays with newly created money  
00:18:10 - 00:18:16: the government coordinates deficit spending by 
selling an equivalent amount of securities but it  
00:18:16 - 00:18:20: is highly misleading to say that the government 
is borrowing money because it isn't relying on  
00:18:20 - 00:18:26: borrowed money at all the federal government is 
not selling bonds because it needs the dollars  
00:18:26 - 00:18:32: bond sales just allow holders of reserve balances 
to trade them in for u.s treasuries it's done to  
00:18:32 - 00:18:37: support interest rates not to fund the government 
a federal government bond is really just a savings  
00:18:37 - 00:18:42: account with the fed what basically happens 
when one purchases a federal government bond  
00:18:42 - 00:18:46: is that one is swapping their money from one 
savings account to another savings account  
00:18:46 - 00:18:50: with the fed you will never have to worry about 
whether a sovereign currency issuing government  
00:18:50 - 00:18:55: like the united states will default on its debt 
because it issues that debt in their own currency  
00:18:56 - 00:19:00: the central bank will always be able to continue 
making the interest payments by crediting the  
00:19:00 - 00:19:06: appropriate bank accounts federal governments with 
currency sovereignty like the united states the uk  
00:19:06 - 00:19:12: canada australia and japan don't actually need 
to issue bonds but they choose to for various  
00:19:12 - 00:19:18: reasons for one government bonds function 
as reliable savings accounts with the fed  
00:19:18 - 00:19:22: where people can collect interest payments 
bonds can be used as a tool to encourage  
00:19:22 - 00:19:28: people to save money and not spend it to clarify 
once again the point is that neither taxpayer  
00:19:28 - 00:19:33: money or a borrowing funds federal government 
spending for countries with currency sovereignty  
00:19:33 - 00:19:38: the federal government spends first 
taxes second and then chooses to issue  
00:19:38 - 00:19:44: debt in the form of bonds with interest which 
functions as safe assets for people's savings  
00:19:44 - 00:19:50: the only so-called economists who don't understand 
this are those whose thinking is stuck in the era  
00:19:50 - 00:19:55: of the gold standard and fixed exchange rates and 
they have not updated their thinking to the modern  
00:19:55 - 00:20:01: monetary system which uses a fiat currency with a 
floating exchange rate while it's really not easy  
00:20:01 - 00:20:06: to simplify if there is one message to take from 
this video that you should most certainly remember  
00:20:06 - 00:20:12: is that governments that issue their own currency 
and issue most of their debt in that currency  
00:20:12 - 00:20:17: cannot run out of money and do not rely 
on the money of taxpayers or bond buyers  
00:20:17 - 00:20:23: now while the government can't run out of money i 
certainly can and with pretty much negligible ad  
00:20:23 - 00:20:27: revenue on these videos i will need your help 
to keep high quality content like this going  
00:20:27 - 00:20:31: and unfortunately i don't get al jazeera 
money or generous donations from leftist  
00:20:31 - 00:20:36: comedy billionaires so if you think these videos 
are important and give you value your collective  
00:20:36 - 00:20:42: support on patreon can make all the difference now 
back to the video but if governments can't run out  
00:20:42 - 00:20:48: of money then what are the limitations to how much 
money they can create why can't they just deposit  
00:20:48 - 00:20:53: each of us a one million dollar check the answer 
is no the government cannot print unlimited money  
00:20:54 - 00:21:00: well technically it can but not without serious 
ramifications mmt obviously recognizes that there  
00:21:00 - 00:21:06: are indeed real limitations to government spending 
but they're not exactly financial limitations the  
00:21:06 - 00:21:12: two biggest limitations to federal government 
spending are number one inflation and number two  
00:21:12 - 00:21:17: most importantly the real resources available in 
the economy let's first look at inflation because  
00:21:17 - 00:21:23: that tends to be what people worry about the most 
inflation is a very multifaceted phenomenon which  
00:21:23 - 00:21:28: would probably require an entire video of its 
own but for now what you need to know is that  
00:21:28 - 00:21:34: inflation is caused by multiple factors inflation 
is simply the continuous increase in prices  
00:21:34 - 00:21:39: most governments usually aim for a stable 
amount of inflation for a healthy economy  
00:21:39 - 00:21:45: and deflation in contrast which is the opposite 
is usually a sign of a stagnating economy but  
00:21:45 - 00:21:49: if prices continue to increase too much while 
incomes stay the same people's money has less  
00:21:49 - 00:21:54: buying power in their own currency thus leading 
to a lower standard of living and when prices  
00:21:54 - 00:21:59: increase so rapidly to the point where they're 
out of control this is when we get hyperinflation  
00:21:59 - 00:22:05: a very rare phenomenon inflation takes shape in 
different forms first there is what is called  
00:22:05 - 00:22:10: demand pull inflation which is when demands for 
goods and services significantly outweighs the  
00:22:10 - 00:22:16: supply for them one could argue that demand pull 
inflation is one of the multiple factors behind  
00:22:16 - 00:22:22: the increase in prices we have seen recently this 
year as businesses are increasing prices to recoup  
00:22:22 - 00:22:27: lost profits from the coronavirus stagnation and 
are capitalizing on the big increase in demand  
00:22:27 - 00:22:33: following the opening up of the economy but this 
is likely not the main cause behind the inflation  
00:22:33 - 00:22:39: we are seeing now what is more relevant right 
now is cost push inflation the second main type  
00:22:39 - 00:22:45: of inflation cost push inflation occurs when there 
are noticeable increases in the costs of important  
00:22:45 - 00:22:51: goods and services where no suitable alternative 
is available for example a serious drought could  
00:22:51 - 00:22:57: lead to massive crop failures and food shortages 
that send prices soaring as supply collapses  
00:22:57 - 00:23:03: or powerful storms could wipe out oil refineries 
causing the prices of energy to spike cost push  
00:23:03 - 00:23:09: inflation is often caused by the rising costs and 
key parts of production such as oil raw materials  
00:23:09 - 00:23:14: and transportation costs which have become very 
relevant in the age of global interconnected trade  
00:23:15 - 00:23:20: examples include supply chain disruptions and 
fluctuations in the price of oil both of which  
00:23:20 - 00:23:25: increase the costs of production and in turn 
caused the prices of many imported goods to rise  
00:23:26 - 00:23:30: this type of inflation is primarily what is to 
blame for the price increases we are seeing in  
00:23:30 - 00:23:35: many countries at the moment contrary to 
the dogma that conservative hyperinflation  
00:23:35 - 00:23:41: hyperventilators will tell you larger deficits 
do not automatically lead to hyperinflation  
00:23:42 - 00:23:46: in fact most of the time they don't even lead 
to much inflation at all as real world evidence  
00:23:46 - 00:23:56: clearly shows us japan has the highest debt to gdp 
ratio in the world of about 256 percent as of 2021  
00:23:56 - 00:24:01: and they have been at the top of that list for 
quite some time now yet for the longest time they  
00:24:01 - 00:24:08: can't even get out of deflation the opposite of 
inflation let that sink in this tends to make the  
00:24:08 - 00:24:13: brains of deficit hawks absolutely explode because 
they haven't accepted two basic facts countries  
00:24:13 - 00:24:19: that issue their own currency and most of their 
debt in that currency cannot run out of money  
00:24:19 - 00:24:25: and two that the cause of hyperinflation is not 
large deficits governments all around the world  
00:24:25 - 00:24:30: including the united states created insane 
amounts of new money after the 2008 crash  
00:24:30 - 00:24:35: and experienced little to no subsequent inflation 
governments have also increased the money supply  
00:24:35 - 00:24:40: even more significantly during the coronavirus 
crash and we have not seen any substantial  
00:24:40 - 00:24:46: inflation until recently due to the supply chain 
disruptions and shortages of important goods the  
00:24:46 - 00:24:51: connection between money creation and inflation 
is not as clear-cut as many people assume it is  
00:24:51 - 00:24:58: rare cases of hyperinflation such as zimbabwe 
venezuela lebanon and weimar germany are  
00:24:58 - 00:25:04: extremely rare and were caused by multiple severe 
catastrophes in their real economy and these  
00:25:04 - 00:25:09: situations were not helped by the fact that all 
of these countries owed an insane amount of debt  
00:25:09 - 00:25:14: in a foreign currency for all the interested nerds 
out there i have some helpful studies listed in  
00:25:14 - 00:25:18: the description if you want to learn more about 
what exactly caused hyperinflation in these places  
00:25:18 - 00:25:23: dr kelton's book the deficit myth also 
has an in-depth chapter on inflation but  
00:25:23 - 00:25:29: the point is is that creating more money does not 
automatically lead to more inflation and inflation  
00:25:29 - 00:25:34: is a multi-faceted phenomenon way beyond the 
scope of this video anyone who gives you a  
00:25:34 - 00:25:40: short oversimplified idea or one single cause 
of inflation is most definitely lying to you  
00:25:40 - 00:25:45: now while creating money does not automatically 
lead to more inflation government spending  
00:25:45 - 00:25:50: does have very important constraints if countries 
do not have the physical productive capacity  
00:25:50 - 00:25:56: capable of producing and consuming an adequate 
amount of goods and services as alluded to earlier  
00:25:56 - 00:26:02: this brings us to the primary limitation of 
money creation and that is the real economy there  
00:26:02 - 00:26:07: are real limits to the amount of workers that 
exist who the government can hire to do things  
00:26:07 - 00:26:12: and there is also a limited amount of natural 
resources available and each country generally  
00:26:12 - 00:26:18: has their own limitations to their productive 
capacity aka their economy's internal speed limit  
00:26:18 - 00:26:23: let's take funding a war as an example just to 
illustrate while we should all be against wars  
00:26:23 - 00:26:28: i hope the libertarian argument that we just 
can't afford it doesn't really hold up it's  
00:26:28 - 00:26:34: just not a good argument because countries with 
currency sovereignty can always afford another war  
00:26:34 - 00:26:39: at least nominally there is a reason why the 
usa is comfortable spending so much money on the  
00:26:39 - 00:26:45: military every year and even spending trillions 
of dollars on things like the iraq and afghanistan  
00:26:45 - 00:26:51: wars the limitations in this case is not the 
amount of money that exists but rather how much  
00:26:51 - 00:26:57: actual people are willing to fight in that war how 
many tanks and weapons are capable of being built  
00:26:57 - 00:27:02: and how much fuel is available to power all of 
these war operations the real horror of these  
00:27:02 - 00:27:09: wars is not the amount of taxpayer money wasted 
but rather the huge loss in real human life that  
00:27:09 - 00:27:16: occurred the us government didn't use taxpayer 
money to pay for the iraq and afghanistan wars  
00:27:16 - 00:27:21: and they didn't use taxpayer money to pay for 
the trillion dollar cares act that recovered the  
00:27:21 - 00:27:27: financial sector during the coronavirus crash same 
goes for the obama stimulus package after the 2008  
00:27:27 - 00:27:33: crash the us government paid for this stuff the 
same way it pays for most things it simply gets  
00:27:33 - 00:27:38: the federal reserve to create money and deposit 
in the appropriate accounts of the actors needed  
00:27:38 - 00:27:43: to make these things happen if the us government 
were to implement an ambitious progressive policy  
00:27:43 - 00:27:48: like a green new deal or a universal basic income 
we would simply do the same thing here is warren  
00:27:48 - 00:27:53: mosler a known mmt economist explaining 
how simple this process would actually be  
00:27:53 - 00:27:59: so when somebody says to me how do we pay for the 
green new deal i say well congress appropriates  
00:27:59 - 00:28:04: the money and then uh the treasury instructs 
the fed to credit the appropriate accounts  
00:28:05 - 00:28:09: and that's how it's paid for and then 
the green new deal people go yeah that
00:28:11 - 00:28:16: okay and so and there's no disputing that you 
can ask anybody in a fed yeah that's how it works  
00:28:16 - 00:28:20: that's how we pay for things we change the number 
in the account who you know who else said well  
00:28:20 - 00:28:24: bernanke said that we have the quote greenspan 
said that we have these quotes from fedship  
00:28:24 - 00:28:28: now the question you have all been waiting for 
which i waited until the end of the video to  
00:28:28 - 00:28:33: discuss because it is the finding of modern 
monetary theory that shocks people the most  
00:28:33 - 00:28:37: if governments with currency sovereignty 
can't run out of money and don't require  
00:28:37 - 00:28:43: taxes to finance federal spending then what is 
the purpose of taxes why do we need taxes at  
00:28:43 - 00:28:48: all the answer might surprise you actually it 
will probably make your head explode there are  
00:28:48 - 00:28:55: multiple reasons for taxation but mmt boils down 
the role of federal taxation to two core purposes  
00:28:55 - 00:29:00: number one governments looking to provision 
themselves and create demand for their currency  
00:29:00 - 00:29:05: a government needs to find ways to get people to 
do things for the society that it's supervising  
00:29:05 - 00:29:10: so the government imposes a tax liability that 
essentially forces people to have to look for work  
00:29:10 - 00:29:16: to earn enough currency to pay the tax by creating 
demand for the currency and getting people looking  
00:29:16 - 00:29:21: for work the state provisions itself and creates 
value for that fiat currency which would have  
00:29:21 - 00:29:27: otherwise been worthless of course pegging a 
currency to gold adds some complications to this  
00:29:27 - 00:29:32: but we left the gold standard a long time ago for 
a reason and because governments primarily run on  
00:29:32 - 00:29:37: fiat currency now it makes more sense to describe 
the modern monetary system that we have now  
00:29:37 - 00:29:41: to clarify once more how governments provision 
themselves and generate demand for the currency  
00:29:41 - 00:29:47: via taxation let me use the following example 
that economist warren mosler likes to use  
00:29:47 - 00:29:51: let's say i have all of you watching this 
video in a room with me and i offer you  
00:29:51 - 00:29:56: one of these tokens to mop the floor for me 
let's call this fiat currency donkey coins  
00:29:57 - 00:30:03: would any of you mop the floor for one donkey 
coin probably not how about for two donkey coins  
00:30:03 - 00:30:09: probably not because they're completely worthless 
now if i had two guards with a machine gun waiting  
00:30:09 - 00:30:13: by the door and you had to hand in one of the 
donkey coins to get out would you then change  
00:30:13 - 00:30:19: your mind everybody would and everybody would 
try to mop the floor because you would need to  
00:30:19 - 00:30:23: in order to earn the donkey coins as you would 
need to pay one of them to the guards in order  
00:30:23 - 00:30:28: to get out the door this analogy essentially 
describes how government taxation works and  
00:30:28 - 00:30:33: how it generates demand for their fiat currency 
this may sound coercive but it's essentially the  
00:30:33 - 00:30:39: reality of how the state works the state by its 
nature always involves some level of coercion  
00:30:39 - 00:30:44: if the state didn't enforce tax collection via 
law enforcement and agencies like the irs then  
00:30:44 - 00:30:49: the value of the currency would essentially become 
worthless the federal government creates a hole in  
00:30:49 - 00:30:54: your pocket with a tax bill in order to get you 
to need their currency so that the government  
00:30:54 - 00:31:00: can then issue that currency and have users of 
that currency work and trade for that currency  
00:31:00 - 00:31:04: most sovereign fiat currencies work this way 
the relationship between state fiat currency  
00:31:04 - 00:31:10: tax liabilities and debt has been well documented 
in the field of anthropology the narrative that  
00:31:10 - 00:31:15: money tokens spontaneously sprung up free of 
state coercion as part of a natural market  
00:31:15 - 00:31:22: evolution from barter has been debunked many times 
many anthropologists most famously the late david  
00:31:22 - 00:31:29: graber call it the myth of barter but the origin 
of money is a complicated topic that we simply do  
00:31:29 - 00:31:34: not have enough time for in this video now let's 
move on to the second main purpose of taxation  
00:31:34 - 00:31:40: to control inflation taxes are one of the many 
methods of reducing inflation by subtracting money  
00:31:40 - 00:31:45: out of the economy this is to control the money 
supply and to prevent the economy from overheating  
00:31:45 - 00:31:51: and it can also prevent people from hoarding 
too much money what a great job that's doing  
00:31:53 - 00:31:59: taxes can also serve other smaller purposes such 
as discouraging certain behaviors like taxes with  
00:31:59 - 00:32:06: things like smoking taxes can also be used for 
moral purposes reducing inequality although the  
00:32:06 - 00:32:12: efficacy of taxes on reducing inequality highly 
depends on the type of taxes and how well they're  
00:32:12 - 00:32:17: enforced okay finally there you have it now it 
should be clear that how are we going to pay  
00:32:17 - 00:32:22: for it is not the question we should be asking 
it's not the government's digital budget that  
00:32:22 - 00:32:27: needs to be balanced it's the real economy the 
only limitations to government spending that we  
00:32:27 - 00:32:32: should be concerned with are the real resources 
in our real economy and not letting inflation get  
00:32:32 - 00:32:37: out of hand not only would policies like building 
good infrastructure and high-speed rail not cause  
00:32:37 - 00:32:43: much inflation but many progressive policies like 
universal care pharmacare and public affordable  
00:32:43 - 00:32:49: housing would actually be deflationary as they 
would significantly lower prices in the cost of  
00:32:49 - 00:32:54: living but if what mmt says is really true then 
how come governments don't embrace it and start  
00:32:54 - 00:32:58: using their budget to actually implement policies 
that optimally benefit their people they sure seem  
00:32:58 - 00:33:03: to do so when it comes to optimally benefiting 
the rich on first glance it might appear that  
00:33:03 - 00:33:09: most politicians are either stupid self-interested 
afraid to challenge a status quo or all of the  
00:33:09 - 00:33:15: above but here is where i would argue that mmt 
does not have the answer in my opinion certain  
00:33:15 - 00:33:20: other schools of thought do mmt is definitely 
useful for monetary policy but it does not  
00:33:20 - 00:33:25: encompass the power dynamics of different economic 
classes and the inherent class interests of the  
00:33:25 - 00:33:30: state to see more about class interests and the 
nature of the state i highly recommend my videos  
00:33:30 - 00:33:36: on the democrats and the stock market i also 
talk about this stuff extensively on my patreon  
00:33:36 - 00:33:41: exclusive podcasts and my second channel one dime 
radio which you should definitely subscribe to
