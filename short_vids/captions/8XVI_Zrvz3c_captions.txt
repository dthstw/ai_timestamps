00:00:00 - 00:00:05: you completed a programming tutorial but
00:00:02 - 00:00:08: still don't know how to code so you take
00:00:05 - 00:00:10: another tutorial and another and another
00:00:08 - 00:00:12: nothing seems to be getting better and
00:00:10 - 00:00:14: you can't figure out why you're putting
00:00:12 - 00:00:16: in all of this time and effort coding
00:00:14 - 00:00:18: these projects but feel no more
00:00:16 - 00:00:21: competent than you did after the first
00:00:18 - 00:00:24: tutorial well congratulations you're in
00:00:21 - 00:00:26: what's known as tutorial help but I'm
00:00:24 - 00:00:29: here to extend you a ladder so that you
00:00:26 - 00:00:32: can climb your way out of this hell hole
00:00:29 - 00:00:36: and become the programmer you've always
00:00:32 - 00:00:38: dreamt of or not it's up to you now just
00:00:36 - 00:00:40: imagine me reading the whole thing like
00:00:38 - 00:00:42: this let me actually close that door
00:00:40 - 00:00:45: over
00:00:42 - 00:00:47: there hey guys welcome to the video I'm
00:00:45 - 00:00:49: A programmer who's built countless
00:00:47 - 00:00:52: projects over the years as a hobbyist as
00:00:49 - 00:00:54: a WABE iOS Developer as a computer
00:00:52 - 00:00:56: science student as a YouTuber as a
00:00:54 - 00:00:58: portfolio Builder and as a professional
00:00:56 - 00:01:00: software engineer and currently building
00:00:58 - 00:01:01: a platform for developers from the
00:01:00 - 00:01:03: ground up now many of those projects
00:01:01 - 00:01:05: haven't seen the light of day but I have
00:01:03 - 00:01:08: found value in every single project I've
00:01:05 - 00:01:10: built more value in these projects than
00:01:08 - 00:01:12: any tutorial or online course I've ever
00:01:10 - 00:01:14: taken so today I've Consolidated a
00:01:12 - 00:01:16: handful of projects I've personally
00:01:14 - 00:01:18: built to share with you complete with
00:01:16 - 00:01:20: instructions on how to do it and the
00:01:18 - 00:01:22: lessons I've learned that way you can
00:01:20 - 00:01:24: build them and hopefully learn just as
00:01:22 - 00:01:26: much as I did and at the end of the
00:01:24 - 00:01:29: video I am going to include a couple of
00:01:26 - 00:01:31: honorable mention projects that I feel
00:01:29 - 00:01:33: like should be added to the list but I
00:01:31 - 00:01:35: didn't as well as a project that I
00:01:33 - 00:01:37: haven't built just yet but that I plan
00:01:35 - 00:01:39: to soon or at least would like to in
00:01:37 - 00:01:41: 2024 the very first project I'm going to
00:01:39 - 00:01:43: talk about has the ability to be
00:01:41 - 00:01:45: difficult for any level of developer
00:01:43 - 00:01:48: whether you're a novice or proficient
00:01:45 - 00:01:49: programmer that is building mini gamess
00:01:48 - 00:01:52: I built many of these back when I was a
00:01:49 - 00:01:55: computer science student around 2017 as
00:01:52 - 00:01:57: well as just as recently is last month I
00:01:55 - 00:02:01: built my first however during my very
00:01:57 - 00:02:02: first programming class ever in Java I
00:02:01 - 00:02:05: remember it like it was yesterday a
00:02:02 - 00:02:08: fully functional game of tic-tac-toe in
00:02:05 - 00:02:11: the terminal using dashes and plus signs
00:02:08 - 00:02:13: and pipes to draw the grid and of course
00:02:11 - 00:02:16: X's and O's for the X's and O's
00:02:13 - 00:02:18: prompting each user to Mark a square on
00:02:16 - 00:02:21: the grid when it's their turn I learned
00:02:18 - 00:02:25: a lot during this process inputs and
00:02:21 - 00:02:27: outputs printing variables functions NFL
00:02:25 - 00:02:30: statements and just by building a game
00:02:27 - 00:02:31: we all already know and love I found
00:02:30 - 00:02:33: that comforting because I didn't have to
00:02:31 - 00:02:35: try to learn about the thing that I was
00:02:33 - 00:02:37: building I got to focus solely on the
00:02:35 - 00:02:38: logic and printing out things in the
00:02:37 - 00:02:41: terminal it really simplified the
00:02:38 - 00:02:43: process for me and gave me a one toone
00:02:41 - 00:02:44: understanding of how code Works to build
00:02:43 - 00:02:46: this yourself you can really use
00:02:44 - 00:02:47: whatever programming language you want
00:02:46 - 00:02:49: just whip up net beans or code blocks
00:02:47 - 00:02:51: which are idees or integrated
00:02:49 - 00:02:53: development environments which I
00:02:51 - 00:02:56: specifically mention because that means
00:02:53 - 00:02:58: they have built-in build and run tools
00:02:56 - 00:03:00: that way you can focus solely on the
00:02:58 - 00:03:01: logic of what you're building instead of
00:03:00 - 00:03:03: trying to figure out how to build it and
00:03:01 - 00:03:05: how to run it you do that start looking
00:03:03 - 00:03:07: up a little bit here and there and start
00:03:05 - 00:03:09: coding that's the way to get it done
00:03:07 - 00:03:11: don't copy and paste whole entire code
00:03:09 - 00:03:13: blocks just start coding little by
00:03:11 - 00:03:15: little if we want to take this minigame
00:03:13 - 00:03:17: project to the next level we can do that
00:03:15 - 00:03:19: too one route is web development I
00:03:17 - 00:03:21: recently built a miname website
00:03:19 - 00:03:23: containing five different games Word
00:03:21 - 00:03:26: Search decryption challenge code trivia
00:03:23 - 00:03:28: card match and riddle reveal this not
00:03:26 - 00:03:30: only reinforces everything I learned
00:03:28 - 00:03:33: from building the tic tac toe game came
00:03:30 - 00:03:36: back 8 n years ago but also adds in that
00:03:33 - 00:03:39: element of front-end development I used
00:03:36 - 00:03:41: react use cases um even more logic than
00:03:39 - 00:03:43: before and to add even more to this
00:03:41 - 00:03:45: getting the website live using GitHub
00:03:43 - 00:03:47: actions and hosting her who by the way
00:03:45 - 00:03:48: is the sponsor of this video but we'll
00:03:47 - 00:03:50: get to them a little bit later just know
00:03:48 - 00:03:53: in the meantime they have an outstanding
00:03:50 - 00:03:54: Black Friday web hosting deal of 85% off
00:03:53 - 00:03:57: it's the best deal I've ever seen them
00:03:54 - 00:03:58: have so if you build any websites at all
00:03:57 - 00:04:00: now is probably the best time to buy
00:03:58 - 00:04:02: hosting especially especially if you use
00:04:00 - 00:04:04: my link in the description and then my
00:04:02 - 00:04:07: code Forest at checkout for an extra 10%
00:04:04 - 00:04:09: off but again more on them later take a
00:04:07 - 00:04:12: look at this it's a onetoone difference
00:04:09 - 00:04:14: in my implementation of Caesar Cipher
00:04:12 - 00:04:15: decryption Challenge on the left you'll
00:04:14 - 00:04:17: see the terminal application that I
00:04:15 - 00:04:19: built with Java and on the right you'll
00:04:17 - 00:04:22: see the web version built with
00:04:19 - 00:04:24: JavaScript and react and CSS and HTML of
00:04:22 - 00:04:26: course same project different languages
00:04:24 - 00:04:28: different desired outcomes to build the
00:04:26 - 00:04:30: website version of mini games all you
00:04:28 - 00:04:33: have to do is whip up something like a
00:04:30 - 00:04:36: vit project using mpm Create V app just
00:04:33 - 00:04:38: do that in VSS code start the server and
00:04:36 - 00:04:40: start coding you're able to build out
00:04:38 - 00:04:42: the logic in front end design from there
00:04:40 - 00:04:44: because you have a working application
00:04:42 - 00:04:46: or we'll call it a website already and
00:04:44 - 00:04:48: you can see every little change that you
00:04:46 - 00:04:50: make now slightly moving on from
00:04:48 - 00:04:52: minigame project while still keeping it
00:04:50 - 00:04:55: in mind because a minigame project or
00:04:52 - 00:04:57: just any sort of video game from back in
00:04:55 - 00:04:59: the day like Tetris or something can
00:04:57 - 00:05:01: also be an Avenue to learn artificial
00:04:59 - 00:05:04: intelligence and I mean the Deep stuff
00:05:01 - 00:05:06: algorithms not the hype in school I
00:05:04 - 00:05:09: built Connect 4 and then I implemented
00:05:06 - 00:05:10: an alphabeing pruning algorithm which is
00:05:09 - 00:05:13: an optimization technique for the minia
00:05:10 - 00:05:15: max algorithm I also built a sodoku
00:05:13 - 00:05:17: solver utilizing a naive backtracking
00:05:15 - 00:05:19: algorithm that simply searches for empty
00:05:17 - 00:05:20: cells and tries a number checking each
00:05:19 - 00:05:22: time if the number will lead to a
00:05:20 - 00:05:24: solution and if not backtracks and tries
00:05:22 - 00:05:27: the next number but that wasn't good
00:05:24 - 00:05:29: enough so I also implemented a smart
00:05:27 - 00:05:32: backtracking algorithm with minimum
00:05:29 - 00:05:34: remaining values or mrv a more optimized
00:05:32 - 00:05:36: backtracking algorithm using the mrv
00:05:34 - 00:05:38: puristic which involves selecting the
00:05:36 - 00:05:40: cell with the fewest legal values to try
00:05:38 - 00:05:42: next reducing the number of branches in
00:05:40 - 00:05:45: the search tree making this algorithm
00:05:42 - 00:05:47: more efficient and I built a soab bond
00:05:45 - 00:05:50: solver with a Litany of algorithms to
00:05:47 - 00:05:52: use like BFS DFS a couple Renditions of
00:05:50 - 00:05:54: AAR with different humanistics a couple
00:05:52 - 00:05:56: of greedy best first searches and
00:05:54 - 00:05:58: uniform cost search this was my first
00:05:56 - 00:06:02: forray into artificial intelligence back
00:05:58 - 00:06:04: in 2017 17 so needless to say I learned
00:06:02 - 00:06:06: a whole lot more than I can simply put
00:06:04 - 00:06:08: into words and keep the scope of this
00:06:06 - 00:06:10: video here now for you to build
00:06:08 - 00:06:12: something like this take the game you
00:06:10 - 00:06:14: already built like sodoku and start with
00:06:12 - 00:06:16: a simple AI technique like a naive
00:06:14 - 00:06:19: backtracking algorithm figure out how to
00:06:16 - 00:06:21: write that and tie it in with your code
00:06:19 - 00:06:23: which is all very simple get it working
00:06:21 - 00:06:25: and then experiment with other
00:06:23 - 00:06:28: algorithms or enhance the existing
00:06:25 - 00:06:30: algorithm to include mrv heris or what
00:06:28 - 00:06:32: have you that's it and by the way I'm
00:06:30 - 00:06:34: giving you loose instructions for a
00:06:32 - 00:06:37: reason because this is similar to what I
00:06:34 - 00:06:39: was given when I built these projects
00:06:37 - 00:06:42: and in doing so I had to figure all of
00:06:39 - 00:06:44: this out myself there's only so much you
00:06:42 - 00:06:47: can learn from following a tutorial
00:06:44 - 00:06:50: online word for word cod line for COD
00:06:47 - 00:06:53: line you can see kind of the overall
00:06:50 - 00:06:57: idea of how a project is built but you
00:06:53 - 00:06:58: don't really learn code or the logic so
00:06:57 - 00:07:00: when you have to figure out these things
00:06:58 - 00:07:02: yourself utilizing the loose
00:07:00 - 00:07:04: instructions that's where you're really
00:07:02 - 00:07:07: going to learn the next project can take
00:07:04 - 00:07:09: shape in many ways it can be GitHub
00:07:07 - 00:07:11: repositories enhanced with a GitHub read
00:07:09 - 00:07:14: me or a custom website laying out what
00:07:11 - 00:07:17: we've built how we built it and why or
00:07:14 - 00:07:19: even a full-fledged interactive website
00:07:17 - 00:07:22: that thoroughly showcases your skills
00:07:19 - 00:07:24: not just on the website but with the
00:07:22 - 00:07:25: website that's right the most boring
00:07:24 - 00:07:27: project on the list but probably the
00:07:25 - 00:07:29: most important if you're looking for a
00:07:27 - 00:07:31: job or just want to showcase your skills
00:07:29 - 00:07:33: portfolio what just about everyone
00:07:31 - 00:07:35: starts out with is a GitHub profile what
00:07:33 - 00:07:37: you see is what you get code and a repo
00:07:35 - 00:07:40: but you can also enhance each individual
00:07:37 - 00:07:42: repo with a readme file to explain what
00:07:40 - 00:07:43: you built and how you built it meaning
00:07:42 - 00:07:45: what languages Technologies and or
00:07:43 - 00:07:47: algorithms did you use and then it would
00:07:45 - 00:07:49: be helpful if you listed out how to use
00:07:47 - 00:07:52: it like I did here with a list of
00:07:49 - 00:07:53: commands or if it's a website linking to
00:07:52 - 00:07:56: the website in the repost description
00:07:53 - 00:07:59: for easy access but to enhance that even
00:07:56 - 00:08:01: more you can also create a profile
00:07:59 - 00:08:04: readme file in GitHub that enhances your
00:08:01 - 00:08:06: homepage to really make that GitHub
00:08:04 - 00:08:07: profile complete and if you've been
00:08:06 - 00:08:08: looking at the screen for the past 10
00:08:07 - 00:08:10: seconds instead of just having me open
00:08:08 - 00:08:11: in an extra Tab while you work on
00:08:10 - 00:08:13: something else maybe you're coding a
00:08:11 - 00:08:15: project or something you would have seen
00:08:13 - 00:08:18: that I build all these things myself you
00:08:15 - 00:08:20: know why though because a lead developer
00:08:18 - 00:08:22: once came and spoke to my program in
00:08:20 - 00:08:25: class back in school and a student asked
00:08:22 - 00:08:27: probably a question we were all thinking
00:08:25 - 00:08:29: how much does a GitHub profile matter
00:08:27 - 00:08:33: when applying to jobs the speaker's
00:08:29 - 00:08:35: response simply it matters but what if
00:08:33 - 00:08:37: I'm not really that proud of my projects
00:08:35 - 00:08:40: the student asked and the speaker said
00:08:37 - 00:08:42: something is better than nothing A
00:08:40 - 00:08:44: GitHub profile with simple projects is
00:08:42 - 00:08:46: better than no GitHub profile at all
00:08:44 - 00:08:47: I'll personally never forget those words
00:08:46 - 00:08:50: even though I'm not actively looking for
00:08:47 - 00:08:52: a job because at that time I wasn't
00:08:50 - 00:08:54: really proud of my projects either they
00:08:52 - 00:08:57: were just silly little basic projects
00:08:54 - 00:08:59: that I knew had no bearing on what you
00:08:57 - 00:09:01: actually built in the field but after
00:08:59 - 00:09:05: after he said that the tech lead who by
00:09:01 - 00:09:07: the way hires more Developers for his
00:09:05 - 00:09:09: Dev team so in other words he knows what
00:09:07 - 00:09:11: he's talking about I uploaded all of
00:09:09 - 00:09:12: those silly little simple projects to my
00:09:11 - 00:09:15: GitHub and have tried my best to
00:09:12 - 00:09:16: maintain my GitHub profile ever since he
00:09:15 - 00:09:19: did specify however that it's not just
00:09:16 - 00:09:22: specific to GitHub of course it's just
00:09:19 - 00:09:24: we want to see what you can do in
00:09:22 - 00:09:26: whatever way you choose to Showcase your
00:09:24 - 00:09:29: work like a website there are two ways
00:09:26 - 00:09:31: to approach a portfolio website though
00:09:29 - 00:09:33: if you're a webdev don't just use the
00:09:31 - 00:09:35: website to Showcase your skills on it
00:09:33 - 00:09:37: but build something that showcases your
00:09:35 - 00:09:39: skills with it a website that if I'm
00:09:37 - 00:09:40: looking for a frontend developer and I
00:09:39 - 00:09:42: click on your website I don't even need
00:09:40 - 00:09:44: to take a look at any of your other
00:09:42 - 00:09:46: projects because I'm just in awe over
00:09:44 - 00:09:48: the amazing portfolio website that
00:09:46 - 00:09:50: you've built I always wanted a website
00:09:48 - 00:09:53: like this myself and maybe one day I
00:09:50 - 00:09:55: will but as a programmer you you kind of
00:09:53 - 00:09:58: realize that guess what not everyone's a
00:09:55 - 00:09:59: web def I mean for example take a look
00:09:58 - 00:10:01: at some of these websites these are some
00:09:59 - 00:10:04: of the most prominent figures in
00:10:01 - 00:10:06: computer science and not exactly
00:10:04 - 00:10:08: breathtaking these websites look like
00:10:06 - 00:10:10: something straight out of the 90s before
00:10:08 - 00:10:12: CSS was invented but their websites
00:10:10 - 00:10:14: aren't indicative of their skills nor
00:10:12 - 00:10:17: should they be these individuals work on
00:10:14 - 00:10:21: computer science theory and algorithms
00:10:17 - 00:10:24: and in that space not web design or web
00:10:21 - 00:10:26: development so no a portfolio website
00:10:24 - 00:10:28: doesn't need to be this beautiful thing
00:10:26 - 00:10:31: that's not a necessity all it has to do
00:10:28 - 00:10:32: is show case your work in your field
00:10:31 - 00:10:37: that's what I did when I built my
00:10:32 - 00:10:39: minimal developer portfolio last year
00:10:37 - 00:10:42: wait crap I kind of forgot I built this
00:10:39 - 00:10:46: thing how do I use this thing help this
00:10:42 - 00:10:48: is my fun little portfolio project that
00:10:46 - 00:10:50: yep still curating most projects are
00:10:48 - 00:10:52: offline on get hope or
00:10:50 - 00:10:54: confidential That was supposed to be a
00:10:52 - 00:10:57: portfolio but I never added the projects
00:10:54 - 00:10:59: so yeah kind of forgot about that one
00:10:57 - 00:11:01: that's not what I meant to pull up this
00:10:59 - 00:11:03: is what I meant to pull up just a little
00:11:01 - 00:11:05: minimal developer portfolio with light
00:11:03 - 00:11:08: and dark mode showcasing a couple
00:11:05 - 00:11:10: projects here linking to them like as
00:11:08 - 00:11:12: you can see here with what I built and
00:11:10 - 00:11:14: how I built it as in languages and
00:11:12 - 00:11:17: Technologies as you can see here a bit
00:11:14 - 00:11:20: more information about myself and well
00:11:17 - 00:11:23: now that I look at it I'm not actually
00:11:20 - 00:11:25: that happy with it not that it's a bad
00:11:23 - 00:11:27: website but as you can see from this
00:11:25 - 00:11:29: video I have a whole hell of a lot more
00:11:27 - 00:11:31: projects than just these three
00:11:29 - 00:11:33: I don't think these three that I have
00:11:31 - 00:11:37: listed on the website are indicative of
00:11:33 - 00:11:40: my skills oh yeah that's right I built
00:11:37 - 00:11:43: this partly for the tutorial last year
00:11:40 - 00:11:46: with new devs in mind who may only have
00:11:43 - 00:11:49: two or three projects to their name
00:11:46 - 00:11:51: that's what I did well yeah if you want
00:11:49 - 00:11:53: to build a minimal developer portfolio
00:11:51 - 00:11:56: I've made two videos on this a showcase
00:11:53 - 00:11:57: as well as as a tutorial video so uh I
00:11:56 - 00:11:59: guess check those out those are the
00:11:57 - 00:12:00: instructions right there for you yeah um
00:11:59 - 00:12:02: I'll link those two videos in the
00:12:00 - 00:12:03: description and if you build a website
00:12:02 - 00:12:05: like that you'll need to host the

00:13:05 - 00:13:10: website builder and this is how you do
00:13:07 - 00:13:11: it under the hosting tab in your H panel
00:13:10 - 00:13:14: set up your premium web hosting or
00:13:11 - 00:13:16: whichever you got click Start now we
00:13:14 - 00:13:17: want to create a new website and then we
00:13:16 - 00:13:21: can go with WordPress psych we're going
00:13:17 - 00:13:23: to go with hostinger Builder with AI and
00:13:21 - 00:13:24: then of course we have to claim our free
00:13:23 - 00:13:27: domain what do we want that to be
00:13:24 - 00:13:29: definitely a.com right but let's go with
00:13:27 - 00:13:32: devotes newsletter.
00:13:29 - 00:13:34: because I need this domain anyway so I
00:13:32 - 00:13:36: might as well get it now all right and
00:13:34 - 00:13:38: then you fill out your personal
00:13:36 - 00:13:41: information you're not going to see mine
00:13:38 - 00:13:44: all right here it is let AI create you a
00:13:41 - 00:13:45: website in minutes start creating I'm so
00:13:44 - 00:13:47: curious what this is going to look like
00:13:45 - 00:13:50: brand name website type description okay
00:13:47 - 00:13:52: I know I picked the devotes URL but this
00:13:50 - 00:13:54: is for me so this is for the portfolio
00:13:52 - 00:13:57: so we're going to say brand name is
00:13:54 - 00:13:59: farest night I am a brand and then we're
00:13:57 - 00:14:01: going to create a portfolio
00:13:59 - 00:14:03: this is my personal software development
00:14:01 - 00:14:05: portfolio that showcases projects I've
00:14:03 - 00:14:07: built complete with an image of it what
00:14:05 - 00:14:10: technologies I use to build them listed
00:14:07 - 00:14:14: out and a description of what it does to
00:14:10 - 00:14:18: build it listed Out Create website all
00:14:14 - 00:14:22: right I'll see you in a
00:14:18 - 00:14:24: second so here is where it sits so home
00:14:22 - 00:14:26: takes you down to portfolio oh no that
00:14:24 - 00:14:29: takes you over to a portfolio page
00:14:26 - 00:14:32: interesting so home we have my name a
00:14:29 - 00:14:33: picture of me presumably about me
00:14:32 - 00:14:35: another picture just to break up the
00:14:33 - 00:14:37: monotony and then we have featured
00:14:35 - 00:14:38: projects recent projects so you can just
00:14:37 - 00:14:40: kind of have like a little Montage of
00:14:38 - 00:14:42: projects here project project project
00:14:40 - 00:14:45: project and then they contact me which
00:14:42 - 00:14:47: is something I also included in my
00:14:45 - 00:14:50: portfolio website come over to portfolio
00:14:47 - 00:14:51: page has that description right here a
00:14:50 - 00:14:54: few more images of your projects and
00:14:51 - 00:14:56: then boom weather app e-commerce website
00:14:54 - 00:15:00: task management you can keep adding
00:14:56 - 00:15:03: sections I like this obviously we would
00:15:00 - 00:15:06: need to fill out our own information
00:15:03 - 00:15:08: within here oh it also has this which I
00:15:06 - 00:15:10: included in my minimal uh website as
00:15:08 - 00:15:12: well what did I name that I have my
00:15:10 - 00:15:15: timeline here and it also has a timeline
00:15:12 - 00:15:16: education work experience freelance
00:15:15 - 00:15:19: projects and you can list whatever you
00:15:16 - 00:15:20: want out within that if you need I'm a
00:15:19 - 00:15:22: software developer with a passion for
00:15:20 - 00:15:24: creating Innovative and userfriendly
00:15:22 - 00:15:26: applications with expertise in various
00:15:24 - 00:15:28: Technologies such as Java Python and
00:15:26 - 00:15:30: JavaScript I have built a diverse range
00:15:28 - 00:15:33: projects that showcase my skills and
00:15:30 - 00:15:35: experience this is actually pretty cool
00:15:33 - 00:15:38: I like that and over here we can add
00:15:35 - 00:15:41: element adjust pages and navigation
00:15:38 - 00:15:44: website Styles start writing a Blog so
00:15:41 - 00:15:45: you can add a CMS aspect into this and
00:15:44 - 00:15:47: then you can also integrate an online
00:15:45 - 00:15:50: store wow I actually didn't know I could
00:15:47 - 00:15:54: do that that's pretty insane huh logo
00:15:50 - 00:15:57: maker AI Rider AI heat map analytics SEO
00:15:54 - 00:15:59: form submission information Integrations
00:15:57 - 00:16:02: what is this Google Analytics WhatsApp

00:16:05 - 00:16:10: not going to lie that's actually really
00:16:07 - 00:16:11: cool I wasn't I wasn't sure how I was
00:16:10 - 00:16:14: going to feel about it I was just going
00:16:11 - 00:16:17: to Showcase it but I will be honest with
00:16:14 - 00:16:18: you I do I like it it's a good starting
00:16:17 - 00:16:20: point for you to be able to build out
00:16:18 - 00:16:22: from there put in your information
00:16:20 - 00:16:25: definitely worth checking out it's
00:16:22 - 00:16:28: included in your hosting or web hosting

00:16:28 - 00:16:33: business whatever the heck the third one
00:16:30 - 00:16:35: is check it out hostinger.com
00:16:33 - 00:16:39: forestnight Link in description use code
00:16:35 - 00:16:40: Forest at checkout for an extra 10% off
00:16:39 - 00:16:43: these next projects are effectively one
00:16:40 - 00:16:46: of the same but both equally as fun my
00:16:43 - 00:16:47: AI robots last year I built an AI Nerf
00:16:46 - 00:16:49: gun that shoots me in the face when I
00:16:47 - 00:16:51: get distracted and this year in 2023 I
00:16:49 - 00:16:53: built an AI coffee gun that feeds me
00:16:51 - 00:16:55: coffee at regular intervals to maximize
00:16:53 - 00:16:57: efficiency both projects utilize
00:16:55 - 00:16:58: artificial intelligence and robots which
00:16:57 - 00:17:00: is a term I'm using in set of internet
00:16:58 - 00:17:02: of things because I don't know Internet
00:17:00 - 00:17:06: of Things is just a really weird term to
00:17:02 - 00:17:09: me you two or just me all right sick I
00:17:06 - 00:17:11: learned about Electronics arduinos
00:17:09 - 00:17:13: tensor flow object detection
00:17:11 - 00:17:15: segmentation real-time face tracking
00:17:13 - 00:17:17: proper GPU utilization Jupiter notebook
00:17:15 - 00:17:19: and so much more and despite the late
00:17:17 - 00:17:21: nights of frustrating errors and just
00:17:19 - 00:17:22: things that shouldn't have been
00:17:21 - 00:17:25: happening in the first place I don't
00:17:22 - 00:17:28: think I've ever had as much fun coding
00:17:25 - 00:17:30: as I did when building these projects so
00:17:28 - 00:17:32: if you're looking for a fun project or
00:17:30 - 00:17:36: you're trying to reignite that spark
00:17:32 - 00:17:38: that you once had for coding this may be
00:17:36 - 00:17:41: the project for you all you need to do
00:17:38 - 00:17:43: is simple just do research buy the stuff
00:17:41 - 00:17:46: install a crap ton of packages and
00:17:43 - 00:17:48: libraries write some code or steal some
00:17:46 - 00:17:49: code you do whatever you want tie the
00:17:48 - 00:17:51: code together you're going to have to
00:17:49 - 00:17:54: work with some Electronics do this do
00:17:51 - 00:17:56: that just that's how you get started and
00:17:54 - 00:17:58: all of this kind of like the overall
00:17:56 - 00:18:01: showcase and how these project projects
00:17:58 - 00:18:03: were built there's two videos about them
00:18:01 - 00:18:05: uh maybe I'll just have a fullon link
00:18:03 - 00:18:07: just a bunch of links about all these
00:18:05 - 00:18:08: projects in the description and you'll
00:18:07 - 00:18:10: be able to see a little bit more of how
00:18:08 - 00:18:13: these projects are done remember they're
00:18:10 - 00:18:15: not tutorials they're showcases and the
00:18:13 - 00:18:18: overall just fun little video with a fun
00:18:15 - 00:18:19: little project but they are helpful to
00:18:18 - 00:18:21: give you an overall idea of how they're
00:18:19 - 00:18:23: built now it's time for the honorable
00:18:21 - 00:18:25: mentions and that one project that I'd
00:18:23 - 00:18:28: like to build but I haven't yet my
00:18:25 - 00:18:31: favorite project of all time the one
00:18:28 - 00:18:34: that broke down that coding barrier for
00:18:31 - 00:18:36: me tournament simulation now this is an
00:18:34 - 00:18:38: honorable mention instead of a main
00:18:36 - 00:18:40: project because I've already made an
00:18:38 - 00:18:43: entire video about it and I don't really
00:18:40 - 00:18:44: want to just rehash all that information
00:18:43 - 00:18:47: that video is probably just as long as
00:18:44 - 00:18:49: this entire video where I go into full
00:18:47 - 00:18:52: detail on the project walk you through
00:18:49 - 00:18:54: everything tell you why I love that
00:18:52 - 00:18:56: project and how it really broke down
00:18:54 - 00:18:58: that coding barrier for me so that's why
00:18:56 - 00:19:00: it's an honorable mention go check out
00:18:58 - 00:19:02: that video for full detail that project
00:19:00 - 00:19:05: is definitely worth building the second
00:19:02 - 00:19:06: honorable mention is a chess AI bot I
00:19:05 - 00:19:10: actually started building one of these
00:19:06 - 00:19:13: back in September or so August to
00:19:10 - 00:19:14: participate in Sebastian log's AI chess
00:19:13 - 00:19:16: tournament thing that you may have seen
00:19:14 - 00:19:18: on YouTube but if you didn't we also
00:19:16 - 00:19:21: mentioned it in the devotes newsletter
00:19:18 - 00:19:22: where he set out specific criteria and a
00:19:21 - 00:19:24: starting point consisting of everything
00:19:22 - 00:19:27: you need whereas all you need to do is
00:19:24 - 00:19:28: implement the AI however the deadline
00:19:27 - 00:19:30: for all of this was a the beginning of
00:19:28 - 00:19:32: October and I kind of had a baby at the
00:19:30 - 00:19:34: beginning of September so I was a little
00:19:32 - 00:19:37: bit preoccupied in the project I'd like
00:19:34 - 00:19:40: to build but haven't yet although I may
00:19:37 - 00:19:42: figure out a way to somehow integrate it
00:19:40 - 00:19:46: into the devotes platform is anything
00:19:42 - 00:19:49: utilizing open AI or chat GPT this could
00:19:46 - 00:19:52: be in the form of a chat GPT Plugin or
00:19:49 - 00:19:55: creating something for open ai's GPT
00:19:52 - 00:19:56: store or it could be something so simple
00:19:55 - 00:19:59: which is what I would do with DeVos
00:19:56 - 00:20:04: platform if I do which I probably will
00:19:59 - 00:20:07: is utilize the open aai API wait I've
00:20:04 - 00:20:09: definitely used the open AI API I that's
00:20:07 - 00:20:13: right I utilized the
00:20:09 - 00:20:15: gpt3 API when I built data set GPT in
00:20:13 - 00:20:17: that video for bright data I don't
00:20:15 - 00:20:20: understand how I forget these things
00:20:17 - 00:20:21: anyway just build some a fun project
00:20:20 - 00:20:23: would be to build something that you can
00:20:21 - 00:20:24: put on the GPT store maybe even
00:20:23 - 00:20:27: potentially make a little bit of money
00:20:24 - 00:20:29: or create a chat GPT plugin preferably
00:20:27 - 00:20:31: the former I just think that would be a
00:20:29 - 00:20:33: pretty cool project to build for now
00:20:31 - 00:20:34: well it looks like it's about time to
00:20:33 - 00:20:36: get back to coding on the devotes
00:20:34 - 00:20:39: platform which by the way we're going to
00:20:36 - 00:20:41: be launching the MVP soon and going to
00:20:39 - 00:20:43: be needing some beta testers here in the
00:20:41 - 00:20:45: next few weeks I'm just saying you
00:20:43 - 00:20:47: should probably get to coding to if you
00:20:45 - 00:20:49: can't decide what project to build just
00:20:47 - 00:20:52: write them all down on a post-er note
00:20:49 - 00:20:53: each stick them on the wall and throw a
00:20:52 - 00:20:55: dart at it it doesn't matter what you
00:20:53 - 00:20:57: build as long as you build something or
00:20:55 - 00:20:59: feel free to check out those project
00:20:57 - 00:21:01: videos I mentioned in this video or do
00:20:59 - 00:21:04: none of that and just tell me to f off I
00:21:01 - 00:21:09: don't care I do hope you have a good day
